  <div class="text transcript ui text container hide-pnum">
  
    <p><sup>29</sup> All special relationships have sin as their goal. For they are
bargains with reality, toward which the seeming union is adjusted.
Forget not this—to bargain is to set a limit, and any brother with whom
you have a limited relationship <em>you hate</em>. You may attempt to keep the
bargain in the name of “fairness,” sometimes demanding payment of
yourself, perhaps more often of the other. Thus in the “fairness” you
attempt to ease the guilt that comes from the accepted purpose of the
relationship. And that is why the Holy Spirit must change its purpose to
make it useful to <em>Him</em> and harmless unto <em>you</em>.</p>

<p><sup>30</sup> If you accept this change, you have accepted the idea of making room
for truth. The <em>source</em> of sin is gone. You may imagine that you still
experience its effects, but it is not your purpose, and you no longer
<em>want</em> it. No one allows a purpose to be replaced while he desires it,
for nothing is so cherished and protected as is a goal the mind accepts.
This it will follow, grimly or happily, but always with faith and with
the persistence that faith inevitably brings. The power of faith is
<em>never</em> recognized if it is placed in sin. But it is <em>always</em> recognized
if it is placed in love.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup> Why is it strange to you that faith can move mountains? This is
indeed a little feat for such a power. For faith can keep the Son of God
in chains as long as he believes he <em>is</em> in chains. And when he is
released from them, it will be simply because he no longer believes in
them, withdrawing faith that they can hold him and placing it in his
freedom instead. It is impossible to place equal faith in opposite
directions. What faith you give to sin you <em>take away</em> from holiness.
And what you offer holiness has been <em>removed</em> from sin.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup> Faith and belief and vision are the means by which the goal of
holiness is reached. Through them the Holy Spirit leads you to the real
world and away from all illusions where your faith was laid. This is His
direction, the only one He ever sees. And when you wander, He reminds
you there <em>is</em> but one. His faith and His belief and vision are all for
you. And when you have accepted them completely instead of yours, you
will have need of them no longer. For faith and vision and belief are
meaningful only <em>before</em> the state of certainty is reached. In Heaven
they are unknown. Yet Heaven is reached through them.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup> It is impossible that the Son of God lack faith, but he can choose
where he would have it <em>be</em>. Faithlessness is not a <em>lack</em> of faith, but
faith in <em>nothing</em>. Faith given to illusions does not lack power, for by
it does the Son of God believe that he is powerless. Thus is he
faithless to himself, but strong in faith in his illusions <em>about</em>
himself. For faith, perception, and belief <em>you</em> made as means for
losing certainty and finding sin. This mad direction was your choice,
and by your faith in what you chose, you made what you desired.</p>

<p><sup>34</sup> The Holy Spirit has a use for all the means for sin by which you
sought to find it. But as He uses them, they lead <em>away</em> from sin
because His purpose lies in the opposite direction. He sees the <em>means</em>
you use but not the <em>purpose</em> for which you made them. He would not take
them from you, for He sees their value as a means for what <em>He</em> wills
for you. You made perception that you might choose among your brothers
and seek for sin with them. The Holy Spirit sees perception as a means
to teach you that the vision of a holy relationship is all you <em>want</em> to
see. Then will you give your faith to holiness, desiring and believing
in it <em>because</em> of your desire.</p>

<p><sup>35</sup> Faith and belief become attached to vision, as all the means that
once served sin are redirected now toward holiness. For what you think
is sin is <em>limitation</em>, and whom you try to limit to the body you hate
because you fear. In your refusal to forgive him, you would condemn him
to the body because the means for sin are dear to you. And so the body
has your faith and your belief. But holiness would set your brother
free, removing hatred by removing fear, not as a symptom, but at its
source.</p>

<p><sup>36</sup> Those who would free their brothers from the body can <em>have</em> no fear.
They have renounced the means for sin by choosing to let all limitations
be removed. Desiring to look upon their brothers in holiness, the power
of belief and faith goes far beyond the body, <em>supporting</em> vision, not
obstructing it. But first they chose to recognize how much their faith
had limited their understanding of the world, desiring to place its
power elsewhere should another point of view be given them. The miracles
which follow this decision are also born of faith. For all who choose to
look away from sin are given vision and are led to holiness.</p>

<p><sup>37</sup> Those who believe in sin <em>must</em> think the Holy Spirit asks for
sacrifice, for this is how they think <em>their</em> purpose is accomplished.
Brothers, the Holy Spirit knows that sacrifice brings <em>nothing</em>. He
makes no bargains. And if you seek to limit Him, you will hate Him
because you are afraid. The gift that He has given you is more than
anything that stands this side of Heaven. The instant for its
recognition is at hand. Join your awareness to what has been <em>already</em>
joined. The faith you give each other can accomplish this. For He Who
loves the world is seeing it for you without one spot of sin upon it and
in the innocence which makes the sight of it as beautiful as Heaven.</p>

<p><sup>38</sup> Your faith in sacrifice has given it great power in your sight,
except you do not realize you cannot see <em>because</em> of it. For sacrifice
must be exacted of a body and by another body. The mind could neither
ask it nor receive it of itself. And no more could the body. The
intention is in the mind, which tries to use the body to carry out the
means for sin in which the <em>mind</em> believes. Thus is the joining of mind
and body an inescapable belief of those who value sin. And so is
sacrifice invariably a means for limitation and thus for hate.</p>

<p><sup>39</sup> Think you the Holy Spirit is concerned with <em>this</em>? He gives not what
it is His purpose to lead you <em>from</em>. You think He would deprive you for
your good. But “good” and “deprivation” are opposites and cannot
meaningfully join in any way. It is like saying that the moon and sun
are one because they come with night and day, and so they <em>must</em> be
joined. Yet sight of one is but the sign the other has disappeared from
sight. Nor is it possible that what gives light be one with what depends
on darkness to be seen. Neither demands the sacrifice of the other. Yet
on the <em>absence</em> of the other does each depend.</p>

<p><sup>40</sup> The body was made to be a sacrifice to sin, and in the darkness so it
still is seen. Yet in the light of vision, it is looked upon quite
differently. You <em>can</em> have faith in it to serve the Holy Spirit’s goal
and give it power to serve as means to help the blind to see. But in
their seeing, they look <em>past</em> it, as do you. The faith and the belief
you gave it <em>belongs</em> beyond. You gave perception and belief and faith
from mind to body. Let them now be given back to what produced them and
can use them still to save itself from what it made.</p>
