<p>Failure is all about you while you seek for goals that cannot be
achieved. You look for permanence in the impermanent; for love where
there is none; for safety in the midst of danger; immortality within the
darkness of the dream of death. Who could succeed where contradiction is
the setting of his searching, and the place to which he comes to find
stability?</p>

<p>Goals which are meaningless are not attained. There is no way to reach
them, for the means by which you strive for them are meaningless as they
are. Who can use such senseless means and hope through them to gain in
anything? Where can they lead? And what could they achieve that offers
any hope of being real?</p>

<p>Pursuit of the imagined leads to death because it is the search for
nothingness, and while you seek for life you ask for death. You look for
safety and security while in your heart you pray for danger and
protection for the little dream you made.</p>

<p>Yet searching is inevitable here. For this you came, and you will surely
do the thing you came for. But the world can not dictate the goal for
which you search unless you give it power to do so. Otherwise, you still
are free to choose a goal that lies beyond the world and every worldly
thought, and one which comes to you from an idea relinquished yet
remembered, old yet new; an echo of a heritage forgot, yet holding
everything you really want.</p>

<p>Be glad that search you must. Be glad as well to learn you search for
Heaven, and must find the goal you really want. No-one can fail to want
this goal, and reach it in the end. God’s Son cannot seek vainly, though
he try to force delay, deceive himself, and think that it is hell he
seeks. When he is wrong he finds correction, when he wanders off he is
led back to his appointed task.</p>

<p>No-one remains in hell, for no one can abandon his Creator, nor affect
His perfect, timeless and unchanging Love. You will find Heaven.
Everything you seek but this will fall away, yet not because it has been
taken from you. It will go because you do not want it. You will reach the
goal you really want as certainly as God created you in sinlessness.</p>

<p>Why wait for Heaven? It is here today. Time is the great illusion it is
past or in the future. Yet this cannot be if it is where God wills His
Son to be. How could the Will of God be in the past or yet to happen?
What He wills is now, without a past and wholly futureless. It is as far
removed from time as is a tiny candle from a distant star, or what you
chose from what you really want.</p>

<p>Heaven remains your one alternative to this strange world you made and
all its ways; its shifting patterns and uncertain goals, its painful
pleasures and its tragic joys. God made no contradictions. What denies
its own existence and attacks itself is not of Him. He did not make two
minds, with Heaven as the glad effect of one, and earth the other’s
sorry outcome which is Heaven’s opposite in every way.</p>

<p>God does not suffer conflict. Nor is His creation split in two. How
could it be His Son could be in hell when God Himself established him in
Heaven? Could he lose what the Eternal Will has given him to be his home
forever? Let us not try longer to impose an alien will upon His single
purpose. He is here because He wills to be, and what He wills is present
now beyond the reach of time.</p>

<p>Today we will not choose a paradox in place of truth. How could the Son
of God make time to take away the Will of God? He thus denies himself,
and contradicts what has no opposite. He thinks he made a hell opposing
Heaven, and believes that he abides in what does not exist, while Heaven
is the place he cannot find. Leave foolish thoughts like these behind
today, and turn your mind to true ideas instead.</p>

<p>No-one can fail who asks to reach the truth, and it is truth we ask to
reach today. We will devote ten minutes to this goal three times today,
and we will ask to see the rising of the real world to replace the
foolish images that we held dear, with true ideas arising in the place
of thoughts which have no meaning, no effect, and neither source nor
substance in the truth.</p>

<p>This we acknowledge as we start upon our practice periods. Begin with
this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I ask to see a different world, and think<br />
A different kind of thought from those I made.<br />
The world I seek I did not make alone,<br />
The thoughts I want to think are not my own.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For several minutes watch your mind and see, although your eyes are
closed, the senseless world you think is real. Review the thoughts as
well which are compatible with such a world, and which you think are
true. Then let them go, and sink below them to the holy place where they
can enter not. There is a door beneath them in your mind which you could
not completely lock to hide what lies beyond.</p>

<p>Seek for that door and find it. But before you try to open it, remind
yourself no-one can fail who asks to reach the truth, and it is this
request you make today. Nothing but this has any meaning now; no other
goal is valued now nor sought; nothing before this door you really want,
and only what lies past it do you seek.</p>

<p>Put out your hand and see how easily the door swings open with your one
intent to go beyond it. Angels light the way, so that all darkness
vanishes and you are standing in a light so bright and clear that you
can understand all things you see. A tiny moment of surprise, perhaps,
will make you pause before you realize the world you see before you in
the light reflects the truth you knew, and did not quite forget in
wandering away in dreams.</p>

<p>You cannot fail today. There walks with you the Spirit Heaven sent you
that you might approach this door some day, and through His aid slip
effortlessly past it to the light. Today that day has come. Today God
keeps His ancient promise to His holy Son, as does His Son remember his
to Him. This is a day of gladness, for we come to the appointed time and
place where you will find the goal of all your searching here and all
the seeking of the world, which ends together as you pass beyond the
door.</p>

<p>Remember often that today should be a time of special gladness, and
refrain from dismal thoughts and meaningless laments. Salvation’s time
has come. Today is set by Heaven Itself to be a time of grace for you
and for the world. If you forget this happy fact, remind yourself with
this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Today I seek and find all that I want.<br />
My single purpose offers it to me.<br />
No-one can fail who asks to reach the truth.”</p>
</blockquote>
