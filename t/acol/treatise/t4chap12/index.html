    <p>12.1 Welcome, my new brothers and sisters in Christ, to the creation of
the future through the sustainability of Christ-consciousness. Today we
join together to birth the new.</p>

<p>12.2 From this time on, I will respond to you through direct
communication or dialogue rather than through teaching. As with all new
means of doing anything, this dialogue must have a starting point. This
is it.</p>

<p>12.3 At this time, there is a gathering of pioneers of the new already
in existence. They are beginning to see that they learn as one. They are
beginning to see that their questions are the same. They are beginning
to see that they share in means not confined to the physical senses.</p>

<p>12.4 This prelude will address them individually and collectively, and
as you join with them in unity, you will realize that it also addresses
you individually and as part of the collectivity of the whole. This
dialogue will, however, be ongoing, and this is your invitation to
participate in this dialogue. No matter where you are, no matter what
concerns you still hold within your heart, no matter what questions are
emanating from your mind, they will be met with a response.</p>

<p>12.5 Two changes of enormous proportions are upon you. The first is the
end of learning, the ramifications of which will only slowly occur to
your mind and be surprising revelations there. The second is the
beginning of sharing in unity, a change that your heart will gladly
accept but that your mind, once again, will be continuously surprised to
encounter.</p>

<p>12.6 Take delight in these surprises. Laugh and be joyous. You no longer
have a need to figure things out. Surprises cannot be figured out! They
are meant to be joyous gifts being constantly revealed. Gifts that need
only be received and responded to.</p>

<p>12.7 Once these dialogues are sustainable without need of the written
word, the written word will be less necessary. In the meantime, let me
explain why these written words are not the acts of an intermediary and
why they represent direct learning.</p>

<p>12.8 The simple and complete explanation of the non-intermediary nature
of this dialogue is that it exists in unity. It is given and received in
unity. Intermediary steps were needed only for the separate state. All
conditions that were intermediary in nature during the time of learning,
are, during the time of sharing, naturally converted to direct
experiences of sharing.</p>

<p>12.9 Thus, if you have been religious, abandon not your churches, for
you will find within them now, direct experiences of sharing. If you
have found guidance and comfort in the written word, abandon not the
written word, for the written word will now elicit direct experiences of
sharing. If you have enjoyed learning through gatherings of students,
gather still, and experience sharing directly. If a time arrives when
you no longer feel drawn to these modes of sharing, share anew in
ever-wider configurations.</p>

<p>12.10 All you must remember now is that the time of learning is past.
While you are still encountering concerns and questions, you will be
prone to continue to think of yourself as a learning being. While these
dialogues continue to address these same questions and concerns, you
will be prone to think of them as teaching dialogues and to consider
yourself still a student.  Considering yourself thus is simply a
condition of the old for which you will need to be vigilant. You will be
again surprised, however, to find what an enormous difference the
release of this idea will make in your capacity to express who you are.
As long as you continue to invite learning, you will continue to invite
the conditions of learning. These are the conditions you have
experienced throughout your lifetime and have expressed a willingness to
leave behind. Only you can leave these conditions behind. The only way
to do so is to, for a short while, be vigilant of your thought patterns
so that you eradicate the idea of learning in separation and replace it
with the idea of sharing in unity. Learning is a condition of the
separated self, which is why it is no longer needed. You will not fully
realize unity while you continue to hang on to this condition of the
separation.</p>

<p>12.11 Another thing that you will want to be vigilant of, dear brothers
and sisters, is the learned wisdom of the past. Let me give you an
example that relates to the state of rebellion that was discussed within
the text of this Treatise.</p>

<p>12.12 This example arose from one of those already gathered who was
ques- tioning the state of contentment. She quoted a learned priest and
scholar who spoke of how he knew, as soon as he was content within the
life of the monastery, that it was time to once again move out into the
world. What he was really saying was that he saw the dawning of his
contentment as the sign that one period of learning was over and that it
was time to move on to the next. During the time of learning, this
statement was consistent with learned wisdom. During the new time of
sharing, there is no “next phase” of learning for you to move on to.
There is no reason for you not to exist in continual contentment.
Continual contentment will not stunt your growth or prevent you from
sharing or from expressing yourself anew.</p>

<p>12.13 Is this not a good example of the learned wisdom that needs to be
left behind? But what of the questions it raises? Do you not respond to
the idea of continual contentment with doubt? Not only doubt that it can
be continual but with doubt that you would desire it to be? These
questions relate to our earlier discussion of temptations of the human
experience. Are you willing to leave them behind? Are you willing, for
instance, to leave behind the idea that contentment cannot and should
not last? That lasting contentment, like unto a lasting peace, would
somehow stunt your growth? Can you see that your idea of growth was
synonymous with your idea of learning? That you were always both
awaiting and dreading your next learning challenge?</p>

<p>12.14 Why was this so? You eagerly awaited each learning challenge in
the hopes that it would bring you to the state in which you now abide!
You dreaded each learning challenge because you feared that it would not
bring you to this state and that you would continue to need to learn,
and to perhaps suffer from, the conditions of learning!</p>

<p>12.15 You have arrived! The long journey that brought you here is over.
Grow not impatient or desirous of a return to journeying before you
begin to experience the joy of sharing and the new challenges of
creating the new! This will be joyous journeying and your challenges
will be joyous challenges!</p>

<p>12.16 The state of rebellion was the effect of the cause of learned
wisdom.  It became part of the nature of the human experience by
becoming so consistent within you that it came, through the passing down
of the human experience, to be integral to your nature. Have you not
always been told and seen examples of man pushing against his limits?
Has not this pushing against limits been called progress? Have not even
the most devastating misuses of power attained through this rebellion
been seen retrospectively as having advanced the cause of man’s
evolution and society’s knowledge?</p>

<p>12.17 This is just a beginning point of your ability to see what learned
wisdom has wrought. This is a necessary end point of your review of your
experience here so that you do not continue to advance learned wisdom.
Learned wisdom will tell you to work hard. Learned wisdom will tell you
that the strong survive, the mighty prevail, the weak shall perish. I
attempted to dislodge much of this learned wisdom during my time on
Earth and man is still puzzling over the meaning of my words. The time
for puzzlement is over. Pass on no more of the prevailing learned
wisdom. I told you once we would create a new language and thus we
shall! We are creators of the new and we must start somewhere. Why not
here?</p>

<p>12.18 Think and speak no more of the suffering of the past. Spread the
joyous news! Tell only joyous stories. Advance the idea of joyous
challenges that allow for all the creativity you have put into
challenges of the past but without the struggle. Let not the idea of
struggle take hold in the new. Let not the idea of fear take hold in the
new. Let not the idea of judgment take hold in the new. Announce far and
wide freedom from the old ideas, the learned wisdom of old. What could
be more invigorating, more challenging, more stimulating to your
enrichment, than throwing out the old and beginning again? And doing so
without effort, without struggle. What could be more looked forward to
than the chance to create the new through sharing in unity and
relationship with your brothers and sisters in Christ?</p>

<p>12.19 I know you still have questions, dear brothers and sisters. I know
that you will experience times of not knowing how to proceed. I know
that you will occasionally have setbacks and choose the conditions of
learning instead of sharing in unity in order to realize some bit of
knowledge that you feel is necessary before you can go on. But I ask you
to try to remember to turn to the new rather than the old each time you
think you are experiencing uncertainty or lack.</p>

<p>12.20 The only thing that is going to hold you back from your ability to
sustain Christ-consciousness is doubt about yourself. You must
constantly remember that doubt about yourself is fear, and reject the
instinct, so engrained into your singular consciousness, to let doubt of
yourself take hold of you. Even though you are abiding now in the state
of Christ-consciousness, the pattern of the old thoughts will continue
until they are replaced by a new pattern. That self-doubt arises in your
thought patterns will not mean that you have cause for self-doubt. You
have no cause for self-doubt because you have no cause for fear. To
dwell in fear will end your ability to dwell within the love that is
Christ-consciousness. As there is no longer any cause for self-doubt
there are no reasons for self-doubt. Do not examine yourself for reasons
for self-doubt when it arises. The self-centeredness of the final stage
of learning is over.</p>

<p>12.21 Your “centeredness” must now be focused on sharing in unity and
relationship, and thus creating anew in unity and relationship. Along
with the creation of a new language, another imperative creation with
which to begin our new work is that of new patterns. The patterns of old
were patterns designed for the optimal benefit of learning. These
patterns were created by the one mind and heart that you share in unity
with God. The new patterns of sharing in unity and relationship and thus
creating unity and relationship are only now being created by the one
mind and heart that you share in unity with God. You will be the
co-creator of the new pattern of consciousness that is sharing in unity
and relationship, as you were once the co-creator of the pattern of
consciousness that was learning.</p>

<p>12.22 Again let me remind you that we are speaking of the new. There has
always been a state of consciousness that we are here calling
Christ-consciousness. There has never been a sustained
Christ-consciousness in form.  The Christ-consciousness that has always
existed, a consciousness of what is, is an all-inclusive consciousness,
the consciousness of the embrace. It is not a learned state, as was the
singular consciousness of the human form. It is your innate
consciousness, a consciousness far too vast to be learned but one easily
shared by all.</p>

<p>12.23 In other words, you, as a being of singular consciousness, could
learn the thought patterns of a singular consciousness because it was a
finite consciousness, a consciousness with limits. You, as a being
joined in Christ-consciousness, must share this consciousness in order
to know it.  It cannot be grasped by the singular consciousness. You
could think of this as something which, were it integrated into the
thought processes of the singular brain, would cause brain damage,
because it would cause an over- load of information. The singular
consciousness would act like a computer with a full drive and reject the
information or be overcome by it if such were possible. Such is not
possible, because Christ-consciousness is not available to the separated
self. Christ-consciousness is the consciousness of unity for unity is
what is.</p>

<p>12.24 You now exist within a shared consciousness. The pattern of a
shared consciousness is one of sharing in unity and relationship. There
is no pattern within it for learning (which is individual), for
individual gain, or for individual accomplishment.</p>

<p>12.25 But realize, those of you who would mourn this as a loss, that you
have already achieved all that was possible to achieve as an individual.
The purpose of individual learning was the return of unity! Pause a
moment here, and celebrate this feat of the personal self! The personal
self, through the self-centeredness of the final stages of learning, has
achieved the ultimate achievement possible! Let yourself be grateful for
the learning you have achieved. Celebrate this graduation, this
anointing, this passage. And leave it behind. Realize that it has made
you new. Rejoice and be glad and turn your attention to the new. Attend
to the dawning of the consciousness of unity. Realize that it is a truly
new state, a state that cannot be learned, a state the awareness of
which can only be revealed to you through unity and relationship.</p>

<p>12.26 Realize this without fear, for I am with you. This is akin to
being stranded in a foreign land with none of the ways you learned how
to adapt in the past being of service to you. That is how new this
is—and more. But the difference is that you are not alone and that you
are not in a foreign land but returned to your home of origin. What you
cannot learn you can remember.  What you cannot learn will simply be
known through sharing.</p>

<p>12.27 It is the way in which you will come to remember and share in
unity that concerns you now and what we are speaking of when we talk of
patterns.  There was a pattern to the process of learning that was
shared by all learners and inherent to your natures. The means were
different for each, but the pattern was the same. There was an overall
design that ensured optimal learning and that design was known to you in
the pattern of that design, a pattern that was part of the pattern of
your thoughts, even after the ego came to rule your thought system.
Without this pattern, the ego could have succeeded in becoming the ruler
of the personal self. Part of this design and pattern was the freedom of
free will.</p>

<p>12.28 Free will continues in the pattern of Christ-consciousness. Love
continues. The individual or singular consciousness that was appropriate
to the time of learning does not continue. Thus the new pattern is one
of creation in relationship and unity rather than learning. What this
means will be revealed to you and shared by all who abide within
Christ-consciousness because you abide in a consciousness of unity
through your choice.</p>

<p>12.29 You do not have to choose to share, because you cannot not share.
You do not have to continually choose unity, because you have already
chosen unity and abide there. You do, however, have to refrain from
choosing separation. You do have to refrain from choosing learning and
the conditions of learning.</p>

<p>12.30 What will help you to remain doubt-free and thus fear-free and
continually able to sustain Christ-consciousness, is coming to know the
new design, and the new patterns that reveal the design. This new
design, and the new patterns that will be helpful to you in its
sustainability, are what must be created through our sharing in unity
and be communicated through our continuing dialogues with one another.</p>

<p>12.31 This is a prelude to but one form of these dialogues. Sharing in
unity is automatic. It is the nature of Christ-consciousness. Once you
have adapted to this nature you will realize that what is communicated
through our dialogues and those you share with your brothers and
sisters, is simply communication of what already is. This will help you
to adapt to the revelations that replace learning. This will help you to
adapt to the truth of a sharing you will have received even before it is
communicated through the means to which you are accustomed. It will help
us together to establish the new patterns by which you and those who
come after you, will more fully come to awareness of all they have
inherited and all it is within their power to create.</p>

<p>12.32 I do not have the answers that would continue to make of me a
teacher and you a student. The answers to the elevation of the personal
self and the living of Christ-consciousness in form are yet to be
revealed and shared.  This is the time that is before us, the time of
creation of the future, the time of the creation of a future not based
upon the past.</p>

<p>12.33 This time is before us. Because you are a being still existing in
form, you still exist in the realm of time and space. Yet time and space
no longer separate us, and the creation of the design or pattern that
reveals our lack of separation is part of the creation that is before
us. It will be mutually decided through the coming revelations and our
responses to the revelations of the new.</p>

<p>12.34 Creation of the new has begun. We are an interactive part of this
creative act of a loving Creator. Creation is a dialogue. Creation—which
is God and us in unity—will respond to our responses. Will respond to
what we envision, imagine and desire. Creation of the new could not
begin without you.  Your willingness for the new, a willingness that
included the leaving behind of the old, a willingness that included the
leaving behind of fear and judgment and a separate will, was necessary
to begin creation of the new. Your former willingness to accept the old
but kept creation’s power harnessed to the old. Does this not make
perfect sense when you realize that creation, like God, is not “other
than” who you are? How could creation proceed on to the new without you?</p>

<p>12.35 What will the future hold? It is up to us dear brothers and
sisters. It is up to us acting as one body, one mind, one heart. It is
up to us creating as one body, one mind, one heart. Because it is the
new future of a new form joined in unity and relationship, the only
guarantees that are known to us is that it will be a future of love, a
future without fear, a future with unlimited freedom. For what more
could we ask? And what more could be asked of us?</p>

<p>12.36 Make no mistake that what is asked of us is everything. What is
asked is our total willingness to abandon the old, our total willingness
to embrace the new. But also make no mistake that what is given to us is
everything. All the power of creation is released onto us. Let us begin.</p>
