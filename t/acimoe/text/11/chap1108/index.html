    <p><sup>61</sup> Miracles demonstrate that learning has occurred under the right
guidance, for learning is invisible, and what has been learned can be
recognized only by its <em>results.</em> Its generalization is demonstrated as
you use it in more and more situations. You will recognize that you have
learned there is no order of difficulty in miracles when you have
applied them to <em>all</em> situations. There <em>is</em> no situation to which
miracles do not apply, and by applying them to all situations, you will
gain the real world. For in this holy perception, you will be made
whole, and the Atonement will radiate from <em>your</em> acceptance of it for
<em>yourself</em> to everyone the Holy Spirit sends you for your blessing. In
every Child of God His blessing lies, and in <em>your</em> blessing of the
Children of God is His blessing to <em>you</em>.</p>

<p><sup>62</sup> Everyone in the world must play his part in the redemption of the
world to recognize that the world <em>has been</em> redeemed. You cannot see
the invisible. Yet if you see its effects, you <em>know</em> it must be there.
By perceiving what it <em>does</em>, you recognize its being. And by <em>what</em> it
does, you learn what it <em>is</em>. You cannot <em>see</em> your abilities, but you
gain confidence in their existence as they enable you to <em>act</em>. And the
<em>results</em> of your actions you <em>can</em> see.</p>

<p><sup>63</sup> The Holy Spirit is invisible, but you can see the <em>results</em> of His
Presence, and through them you will learn that He is there. What He
enables you to do is clearly <em>not</em> of this world, for miracles violate
every law of reality as this world judges it. Every law of time and
space, of magnitude and mass, of prediction and control is transcended,
for what the Holy Spirit enables you to do is clearly beyond <em>all</em> of
them. Perceiving His results, you will understand <em>where</em> He must be and
finally <em>know</em> what He is.</p>

<p><sup>64</sup> You cannot see the Holy Spirit, but you can see His manifestations.
And unless you do, you will not realize He is there. Miracles are His
witnesses and speak for His Presence. What you cannot see becomes real
to you only through the witnesses who speak for it. For you can be
<em>aware</em> of what you cannot see, and it can become compellingly real to
you as its presence becomes manifest <em>through</em> you. Do the Holy Spirit’s
work, for you <em>share</em> in His function. As your function in Heaven is
creation, so your function on earth is healing. God shares His function
with you in Heaven, and the Holy Spirit shares His with you on earth.</p>

<p><sup>65</sup> As long as you believe you have two functions, so long will you need
correction. For this belief is the <em>destruction</em> of peace, a goal in
direct opposition to the Holy Spirit’s purpose. You see what you
<em>expect</em>, and you expect what you <em>invite.</em> Your perception is the
result of your invitation, coming to you as you sent for it. Whose
manifestations would you see? Of whose presence would you be convinced?
For you will believe in what you <em>manifest</em>, and as you look out, so
will you see in. Two ways of looking at the world are in your mind, and
your perception will reflect the guidance you chose.</p>

<p><sup>66</sup> I am the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, and when you see me, it
will be because you have invited Him. For He <em>will</em> send you His
witnesses if you will but look upon them. Remember always that you see
what you seek, for what you seek you <em>will</em> find. The ego finds what
<em>it</em> seeks and <em>only</em> that. It does not find love, for that is <em>not</em>
what it is seeking. Yet seeking and finding are the same, and if you
seek for two goals you will find them, but you will <em>recognize neither</em>.
For you will think they are the same because you <em>want</em> them both. The
mind always strives for integration, and if it is split and wants to
<em>keep</em> the split, it will believe it has one goal by <em>making</em> it one.</p>

<p><sup>67</sup> We said before that <em>what</em> you project is up to you, but it is <em>not</em>
up to you <em>whether</em> to project, for projection is a law of mind.
Perception <em>is</em> projection, and you look in <em>before</em> you look out. As
you look in you choose the guide for seeing, and <em>then</em> you look out and
behold his witnesses. This is <em>why</em> you find what you seek. What you
want in <em>yourself</em>, you will make manifest by projection, and you will
accept it <em>from</em> the world because you put it there <em>by</em> wanting it.</p>

<p><sup>68</sup> When you think you are projecting what you do <em>not</em> want, it is still
because you <em>do</em> want it. This leads directly to dissociation, for it
represents the acceptance of two goals, each perceived in a <em>different</em>
place, separated from each other <em>because</em> you made them different. The
mind then sees a divided world <em>outside</em> itself but not <em>within</em>. This
gives it an illusion of integrity and enables it to believe that it is
pursuing one goal. As long as you perceive the world as split, <em>you</em> are
not healed. For to be healed is to pursue one goal because you have
<em>accepted</em> only one and <em>want</em> but one.</p>

<p><sup>69</sup> When you want <em>only</em> love you will see nothing else. The
contradictory nature of the witnesses you perceive is merely the
reflection of your conflicting invitations. You have looked upon your
minds and accepted opposition there, having <em>sought</em> it there. But do
not then believe that the witnesses for opposition are true, for they
attest only to <em>your</em> decision about reality, returning to you the
message you <em>gave</em> them. Love is recognized by its messengers. If you
make love manifest, its messengers will come to you because you
<em>invited</em> them.</p>

<p><sup>70</sup> The power of decision is your one remaining freedom as a prisoner of
this world. <em>You can decide to see it right.</em> What <em>you</em> made of it is
<em>not</em> its reality, for its reality is only what you <em>gave</em> it. You
cannot really give anything but love to anyone or anything, nor can you
really <em>receive</em> anything else from them. If you think you have received
anything else, it is because you have looked within and thought you saw
the power to give something else <em>within yourself</em>. It was only this
decision that determined what you found, for it was the decision of what
you <em>sought</em>.</p>

<p><sup>71</sup> You are afraid of me because you looked within and are afraid of what
you saw. Yet you could not have seen reality, for the reality of your
mind is the loveliest of God’s creations. Coming only from God, its
power and grandeur could only bring you peace <em>if you really looked upon
it.</em> If you are afraid, it is because you saw something <em>that is not
there.</em> Yet in that same place, you could have looked upon me and all
your brothers in the perfect safety of the mind which created us. For we
are there in the peace of the Father, Who wills to project His peace
through <em>you</em>.</p>

<p><sup>72</sup> When you have accepted your mission to <em>project</em> peace, you will
<em>find</em> it, for by <em>making it manifest</em>, you will <em>see</em> it. Its holy
witnesses will surround you because you <em>called</em> upon them and they will
come to you. I have heard your call and I have answered it, but you will
not look upon me nor <em>hear</em> the answer which you sought. That is because
you do not yet want <em>only</em> that. Yet as I become more real to you, you
will learn that you <em>do</em> want only that. And you will see me as you look
within, and we will look upon the world as God created it together.
Through the eyes of Christ, <em>only</em> the real world exists and can <em>be</em>
seen. As you decide, so will you see. And all that you see but witnesses
to your decision.</p>

<p><sup>73</sup> When you look within and see me, it will be because you have decided
to manifest truth. And as you manifest it, you will see it both without
<em>and</em> within, for you will see it without <em>because</em> you saw it first
within. Everything you behold without is a judgment of what you beheld
within. If it is <em>your</em> judgment, it will be wrong, for judgment is not
your function. If it is the judgment of the Holy Spirit, it will be
right, for judgment <em>is</em> His function. You share His function only by
judging as <em>He</em> does, reserving no judgment at all unto yourselves. For
you will judge <em>against</em> yourselves, but <em>He</em> will judge <em>for</em> you.</p>

<p><sup>74</sup> Remember, then, that whenever you look without and react unfavorably
to what you see, you have judged yourself unworthy and have condemned
yourself to death. The death penalty is the ego’s ultimate goal, for it
fully believes that you are a criminal, as deserving of death as God
knows you are deserving of life. The death penalty never leaves the
ego’s mind, for that is what it always reserves for you in the end.
Wanting to kill you as the final expression of its feeling for you, it
lets you live but to await death. It will torment you while you live,
but its hatred is not satisfied until you die. For your destruction is
the one end toward which it works, and the only end with which it will
be satisfied.</p>

<p><sup>75</sup> The ego is not a traitor to God to Whom treachery is impossible, but
it <em>is</em> a traitor to you who believe <em>you</em> have been treacherous to your
Father. That is why the <em>undoing</em> of guilt is an essential part of the
Holy Spirit’s teaching. For as long as you feel guilty, you are
listening to the voice of the ego, which tells you that you <em>have</em> been
treacherous to God and therefore <em>deserve</em> death. You will think that
death comes from God and <em>not</em> from the ego because, by confusing
yourself <em>with</em> the ego, you believe that <em>you</em> want death. And from
what you want, God does <em>not</em> save you.</p>

<p><sup>76</sup> When you are tempted to yield to the desire for death, <em>remember that
I did not die</em>. You will realize that this is true when you look within
and <em>see</em> me. Would I have overcome death for myself alone? And would
eternal life have been given me of the Father <em>unless</em> He had also given
it to you? When you learn to make <em>me</em> manifest, <em>you</em> will never see
death. For you will have looked upon the deathless in <em>yourself</em>, and
you will see only the eternal as you look out upon a world that <em>cannot</em>
die.</p>
