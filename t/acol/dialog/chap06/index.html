    <p>6.1 Within the text of the coursework provided you heard many ideas that
either changed or reinforced those you already had about yourself. A
Course of Love is a teaching text and the goal of its teaching was
stated and restated many times so that you would not forget the purpose
of the learning you were participating in. Eventually your learning
reached an end point as the learning goal of this Course was met, and
this you were told as well. I say this to remind you that the time of
“teaching” like the time of “learning” had its place as well as its
methods.</p>

<p>6.2 One of the methods employed by your teacher within the text of your
coursework was that of comparison, a method that will be used less and
less as the time of learning passes. The thought reversal of which we
recently spoke is why I bring this up. During your time of learning, I
used a method of comparison—I compared the real to the unreal, the false
to the true, fear to love—in order to point out the insanity of your
perception and the perfect sanity of the truth. For some of you the
repetition of the properties of the false that aided your learning may
now work as a detriment to your acceptance as you cling to ideas
concerning false representation rather than let them go in order to
embrace true representation. In the time of learning, you were so
entrenched in your false beliefs that their insanity needed to be stated
and stated again. But as we enter this new time of elevated form, these
same ideas—ideas that many of you attached to form rather than to your
perception of form—must be rejected.</p>

<p>6.3 This is what I have already spoken of and speak of again as a
revisioning of what you believe imprisons you.</p>

<p>6.4 While the false representation of the body as the self was almost as
detrimental to your learning as the false representation of the ego as
the self, the body, given your choice to return to who you truly are
while still in form, continues, while the ego, of course, does not. Your
belief in the non-existence of the ego is now total and has brought a
freedom and a liberation in which you rejoice. Your true Self is
beginning to reveal itself to you in ways of which you will become
increasingly aware. As you identify more intimately with the Self you
truly are, the self of form is likely to grow more and more foreign to
you and less and less comfortable. Thus what is required now is a new
way of envisioning the body and its service to you.</p>

<p>6.5 Like all that was created for the time of learning, the body was the
perfect learning device. Seeing it as such assisted us in bringing about
the end of the time of learning. But now your body—your form—must be
seen in a new way. It is thus with new ideas about the body that we will
begin the final thought reversal that will allow you to live in form as
who you truly are.</p>

<p>6.6 The body, as all else you see among the living, is, in fact, living.
It exists as living form. And so we begin with a distinction between
what exists as living form, and what exists as inanimate or non-living
form. While you might think this is an easily drawn distinction—and it
is—it is not perhaps as you have previously seen it, for everything that
exists in form is of the same Source. Even those things you have made
you have not made from nothing. There is not one thing that you have
made that does not exist as some variation of what was originally
created. Because, and this cannot be repeated enough, creation begins
with what is. And so even the creations you have made are only distinct
from what was originally created in your perception of what they are or
what you have determined their use to be. There is thus truth, or what
we might call the seeds of the truly real, or the energy of creation, in
everything that exists in form.</p>

<p>6.7 It is your perception of the forms around you as non-living forms
that cause them to have rigidity and a particular meaning. But they
still are real, even if they are not as they appear to be to the body’s
eyes.</p>

<p>6.8 What is not real are the things that you have made to represent what
is real since you didn’t understand what it was you were making things
to represent. These are the systems we have already spoken of: Systems
of justice, systems of government, systems of corporations, the systems
of economics and science—the systems—in short, of what you think governs
you.</p>

<p>6.9 In the Bible there were many stories about miracles, both before and
after the time in which I lived. If you were to pose to a scientist
whether or not these miracles were possible, they would tell you of all
the “laws” of science that would be opposed to them occurring. You would
be told that if the sun had “stood still” galactic catastrophes would
have resulted, that there are reasons Noah’s flood could not have
occurred as described, or that it would have been impossible to
repopulate the earth afterwards even if it had taken place as described.</p>

<p>6.10 What these laws of science do not take into account are the laws of
God. Although science is beginning to see much as it truly is,
scientists still look for natural laws that govern what is in an “if
this, then that” world.</p>

<p>6.11 This same kind of attitude still governs your ideas about the body
and the systems of the world in which you exist. If you are no longer
living in an “if this, then that” world, then the same laws will
naturally not apply. You developed an “if this, then that” world because
it was the easiest way in which to learn. It was the easiest way in
which to learn because it seemed to provide proof. Yet if science
teaches anything, it teaches that what is proven can be disproved—and
often is. Thus the prayer of the Native Americans who thank the sun for
rising each day is a prayer that acknowledges that the sun may not rise.
This is not a doomsday attitude, but an attitude that accepts that
scientific or natural law and the law of spirit are not the same.</p>

<p>6.12 There are many stories in many cultures that celebrate and bear
witness to the happenings that reveal that the laws of spirit and the
laws of man coexist. Yes, there are natural laws, but these “natural”
laws are not the sets of facts you have defined them to be, but rather a
staggering series of relationships, relationships without end,
relationships that exist in harmony and cooperation. This is a harmony
and cooperation that might one day extend to the sun and a demonstration
that the sun need not rise—or perhaps need not set—and the earth would
still be safely spinning in its orbit.</p>

<p>6.13 Now if this were to happen, scientists would quickly determine the
existence of a natural law that allowed this event to happen. It would
require the re-working of many previously known “scientific facts,” but
this would not prevent them from discovering new “scientific facts.” I
mean no disrespect to scientists and bless them for their desire to find
the “truth,” as you should bless them for the certainty they have given
you in an uncertain world. Even if it has been a false certainty, it
served a great purpose in the time of learning. Discovery has been a
grand facilitator of the human spirit’s quest for the truth and is part
of what brought you, finally, to the quest to know your Self.</p>

<p>6.14 I am calling all of this to mind in order to begin our discussion
concerning the suspension of belief. If you continue into the new with
your old ideas about your body, the old body will be what you carry into
the new with you. So let us begin with a suspension of belief in what
you think you know about the body, in what science would tell you about
the body, in what you have experienced as a body—a suspension of belief
that comes in the same spirit as that of the Native American who knows
that the sun may rise and may set, but also knows that it may not. I am
speaking of a spirit that is open to the discovery of something new and
“unbelievable” and even “scientifically impossible,” as well as to the
creation of something new. For in this time of revelation, discovery is
the new divine pattern that will replace the “thought” systems we have
spoken of. To discover is simply to find out what you did not previously
know.</p>

<p>6.15 Creation of the new will be predicated on the discovery of what you
did not previously know. This will not happen if you cling to “known”
truths. Revelation cannot come to those who are so “certain” of what is
that they cannot allow for the new to be revealed. Your certainty about
what is is a false certainty, a learned certainty based on the fear that
caused you to order the world according to a set of facts and rules.</p>

<p>6.16 Be jubilant rather than hesitant about the time of discovery that
is before you. Calling what you think you know into question is not a
call to return to uncertainty, but a call to allow real certainty to
come.</p>

<p>6.17 If you think of the “old” as a world in which an attitude of “if
this, then that” ruled, and the “new” as a world in which giving and
receiving are one, you will begin to see the enormity of the thought
reversal that now awaits your acceptance. As I said earlier, we begin by
applying this new attitude to the body.</p>

<p>6.18 You have been taught that if you take care of the body in certain
ways, then good health will result. You have been taught that if your
body expends energy, then it will need the refueling provided by food or
rest. The list could be endless, but these examples will suffice. These
modes of behavior concerning the body were given to teach and to
represent. What you have done is turn them into implacable rules you
call natural laws. When these natural laws have been shown at times to
not apply, you consider these instances flukes or miracles.</p>

<p>6.19 When a person who has exhibited healthy habits get sick, you think
it is unfair. When a person who has exhibited unhealthy habits gets
sick, you think, even if you would not say, that they “did it to
themselves” or that they could have prevented it by abstaining from the
unhealthy habits. You might look now at these two attitudes and see that
they are somewhat silly, but still you would cling to them because you
would believe the person of healthy habits has a greater chance of not
getting sick than the person of unhealthy habits. Again we could go into
countless examples of this type of thinking, but the examples matter not
except to make you see that these attitudes are not ruled by certainty,
but by a mere idea of bettering the odds against what fate may offer.</p>

<p>6.20 What fate may offer is itself an attitude that puts life at the
risk and whim of an external force that has no reality except in your
imagination. What is this thing called fate? Like all the systems you
believe in, it is a system too, an internal idea given a name,
externalized, and blamed for all that you do not understand, all that
cannot be made to make sense, all that seems unfair and beyond your
control.</p>

<p>6.21 When you remember that we have left blaming behind, you will see
that belief in fate is just as systematic and in need of being left
behind as is belief that illness can be blamed on certain habits. This
may not be the type of blaming you see as easily as that of blaming a
friend for your hurt feelings, or blaming the past for the present. And
yet, what ridding your mind of ideas of placing blame does, is take it
one step away from the thinking of the “if this, then that” thought
system we are leaving behind. As a non-learning being you are now called
to accept that you no longer need this type of learning device and to
realize that it will no longer serve you.</p>

<p>6.22 Let us return now to the beginning and start with the body as a
given. It is what it is in terms of flesh and bone, and it is also the
form that is now serving to represent the truth of who you are. How
might this change the “laws” of the body, the laws you gave the body in
the time of learning, knowing not what the design of the body
represented? What might the bodily design now represent?</p>

<p>6.23 The first example of the body we presented newly was that of the
perfect design of the joining provided through sexual intercourse—a
design given to lead the way to desire for oneness and completion.</p>

<p>6.24 We have talked of but one replacement for the pattern of
learning—the pattern of acceptance. What might the body be called to
accept? This is an easy answer, as you have already called upon the body
to accept the indwelling of Christ. You have replaced the personal self,
the self of learning, with the true Self. You have accepted your true
identity. How could the body now be the same as it once was?</p>

<p>6.25 The body was, in the time of learning, representative of a learning
being. The ego, however, narrowed your ideas of what the body was here
to learn to ideas of survival. You thus learned to survive rather than
to live. You increased the life span of the human being, but you
increased not its capacity for true living or true learning. And with
the extended life span came extended reasons for fear, and a physical
form that you came to believe needed greater and greater resources to
maintain.</p>

<p>6.26 The body is now the embodiment of the true Self, the embodiment of
love, the embodiment of divinity. Its existence is given as it was
always given. But now the very nature of its existence has changed. I
say changed here because you may remember that change occurs in time.
Outside of time and form your Self has always existed in the perfect
harmony in which it was created. Now that your Self has joined the
elevated Self of form, you exist together both in time and outside of
time. Remember, the elevated Self of form will never be all that you
are. This does not imply however, that there are portions of your Self
missing from this new experience in form you now enter into, but that
the elevated Self of form is now able to join with the Self in the unity
of shared consciousness. You are whole once again and your form will
merely represent one aspect of your wholeness in the field of time.</p>

<p>6.27 The self of form, as form, could never truly experience the All of
Everything that is the natural state of the formless. But the true Self
cannot cease to experience its natural state, the state of
Christ-consciousness, sharing in unity, the All of Everything. So these
two states, the state of form and the state of unity, are both in
existence right now. In the state of unity, your true Self is fully
aware of the elevated Self of form and is fully participating in its
experiences and feelings. The elevated Self of form, however, being a
form that still exists in time, must realize the consciousness of the
true Self in time. What this means is that the elevated Self of form may
still need “time” to come to know the changes that only occur in “time”
although they are already accomplished in unity. This is why we have
spoken of miracles and of the collapse of time the miracle is capable of
providing. We have redefined the miracle as the art of thought, or the
continual act of prayer that sustains the unity of Christ-consciousness.</p>

<p>6.28 Form and time go together. Yet you have been told time is a
measurement of learning. If you are no longer a learning being, for what
is time needed? Time is needed now only for the transformation of the
self from a learning being to a being that can accept the shared
consciousness of unity and begin to discover what this means.</p>
