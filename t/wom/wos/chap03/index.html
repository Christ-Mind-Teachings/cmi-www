</div>

<p class="top"><span class="dropcaps">H</span>e who looks upon me<br />
and truly <em>sees</em> me<br />
has learned<br />
to look upon himself<br />
<em>as our Father knows him.</em></p>

<p>She who sees me,<br />
thus has she seen<br />
the One who has sent me,<br />
even as she, too,<br />
has been sent of the Father<br />
to proclaim but this:</p>

<p class="indent">Love alone is Real.<br />
God is but Love.<br />
Therefore,<br />
God <strong>is</strong>.</p>

<p>Herein lies the meaning of my words,<br />
read often,<br />
yet often not understood:</p>

<p class="indent">It is not possible<br />
for what is Real to be threatened,<br />
nor is it possible<br />
for what is unreal to exist.</p>

<p>Because you know <em>only</em> that you exist,<br />
you must be in God,<br />
and cannot be threatened<br />
in any way.</p>

<p>Nor does the illumined mind<br />
behold the place where it begins<br />
and God ends.</p>

<p>For what alone is Real<br />
is without beginning or end.</p>

<p>Yet,<br />
always does such a mind<br />
recognize that it is created,<br />
and not Creator,<br />
knowing not the unfathomable Source<br />
of its beginning.</p>

<p>This recognition<br />
is the seat of humility.<br />
Humility begets<br />
the recognition of freedom,<br />
and in perfect freedom<br />
lies true power:</p>

<p class="indent">I can do absolutely nothing,<br />
nor need I do anything,<br />
for the One who has sent me<br />
alone does all things.</p>

<p>Joy flows gently from the heart<br />
of one who has awakened.</p>

<p>It is a joy<br />
neither created nor possessed,<br />
but <em>allowed</em>.<br />
Flowing as the radiant extension<br />
of a Light that meets no obstacle,<br />
it attracts those<br />
who would choose to Remember,<br />
and behold themselves reflected<br />
in the one who has awakened.</p>

<p>When you see me<br />
in the face of your brother and sister,<br />
you become the mirror<br />
of their only Reality,<br />
and in <em>you</em> can they know Christ.</p>

<p>Therefore,<br />
your relationship with each of them<br />
is the means of your salvation,<br />
and your only appropriate gift to them<br />
is to be one who has refused to tolerate<br />
the error of separation<br />
in yourself,<br />
offering to them the gift of <em>their</em> perfect –<br />
and holy –<br />
reflection.</p>

<p>The holiest place on Earth is, indeed,<br />
wherever an ancient hatred<br />
has become a present love.<br />
Hatred <em>is</em> ancient,<br />
being born of separation;<br />
having a beginning,<br />
it must have an end.</p>

<p>Love,<br />
being of God,<br />
knows neither beginning nor end.</p>

<p>To offer your brother and sister<br />
the gift of your holiness<br />
is to offer the gift of what is eternal.<br />
Eternity must speak to them of Grace,<br />
and by Grace and Grace alone<br />
the world is overcome.</p>

<p>Join with me<br />
and offer our friends<br />
the holiness<br />
you share with me<br />
from before the foundations<br />
of the world.</p>

<p>Nothing beyond this<br />
can be found,<br />
and in this<br />
there is nothing lacking.<br />
All searching has ended,<br />
and in what is eternal<br />
there can be nothing you want still.</p>

<p>In giving your Self,<br />
you must remember your Self.<br />
This alone<br />
is the straight and narrow path,<br />
the bridge given you when,<br />
in a distant and forgotten past,<br />
you looked upon one insane thought,<br />
<em>and failed to laugh</em>.</p>

<p>Your seriousness<br />
made the insanity of separation<br />
seem real to you.</p>

<p>Gone now is all fear,<br />
for we see together<br />
that what is unreal<br />
cannot possibly exist.</p>

<p>Now,<br />
we are safe.<br />
Now,<br />
peace has come.<br />
Giving this alone to everyone,<br />
we have received it forever.</p>

<p>The servant gives,<br />
and therefore receives.</p>

<p>I have said<br />
that I come to gather my friends<br />
to myself.</p>

<p>Gather those who are given to you,<br />
and it is enough.<br />
And because you have received<br />
the ones I send to you<br />
in order that they might behold<br />
in your holiness<br />
their true reflection,<br />
verily,<br />
you have received me.<br />
And our friendship must be eternal,<br />
being established in God.</p>

<p>When I said,<br />
“Go, and do likewise,”<br />
it is just this<br />
to which I was referring.</p>

<p class="indent">For as many as received Him,<br />
gave He the power to become<br />
the Sons and Daughters<br />
of the Living God.</p>

<p>This can only mean<br />
that when you give the gift<br />
of <em>your</em> holiness,<br />
you have paid witness to the truth<br />
that you <em>have</em> received me.</p>

<p>Because you have allowed me<br />
to raise you from the dead,<br />
<em>you</em> are the one<br />
in whom I now live,<br />
and the only logical meaning<br />
of the Second Coming<br />
is witnessed by those<br />
who are given to you.</p>

<p>If but one of our precious friends<br />
sees that I live in you,<br />
<em>the whole of Creation is uplifted.</em></p>

<p>You are sent forth “in my name”<br />
to extend the power to awaken<br />
unto all who will be sent to you,<br />
and in you will they be provided<br />
with the opportunity to see themselves<br />
as they are held eternally<br />
in the mind of God.</p>

<p>Remember<br />
that in the Kingdom<br />
there is no effort.<br />
Because you are awake in me,<br />
<em>you need do nothing,</em><br />
yet not one thing<br />
shall be left undone.<br />
And what I ask of you<br />
you will accomplish,<br />
because our wills are joined.</p>

<p>It is not possible that you fail,<br />
for this would mean<br />
that God has failed me,<br />
and my Father fails not his Son.</p>

<p>The choice for Love,<br />
which is the end of fear,<br />
is the choice to see<br />
with the eyes of Christ:</p>

<p class="ident">God has not failed me,<br />
and I cannot fail those<br />
who are sent to me,<br />
because the One who has sent me<br />
lives in me.</p>

<p>Giving them to God –<br />
by seeing that Christ is in them –<br />
they are received <em>through</em> me,<br />
but <em>by</em> God,<br />
who receives his own.</p>

<p>All praise to the One<br />
beyond all comprehension!<br />
I am <em>not</em> the doer,<br />
I am <em>not</em> the maker.<br />
I AM<br />
but the humble servant,<br />
allowing<br />
the witnessing of Love in me,<br />
<em>because</em> Christ lives in me.<br />
And this <em>is</em> enough.</p>

<p>What perfection the world reveals!</p>

<p>What sublime beauty<br />
do all things show me!</p>

<p>My joy<br />
is beyond measure,<br />
my pleasure unending!</p>

<p>Weariness is gone,<br />
and the dance begun.</p>

<p>The song of the One<br />
in whom I dwell<br />
lifts me gently in dancing!</p>

<p>The leaves tossed in the wind,<br />
the laughter of a child,<br />
the radiance of the farthest star,<br />
each one who stands before me,<br />
these are the partners<br />
with whom I dance!</p>

<p>Perfection shines forth<br />
in all things;<br />
the weaver of the dance is trusted.</p>

<p>If I am with you in this moment,<br />
we dance as friends in holiness,<br />
for we cannot fail to be<br />
where God has asked us to be.</p>

<p>The eternal melody shifts,<br />
and moves on.<br />
I dance with the one sent unto me,<br />
yet lose not the one<br />
who appears to have gone.<br />
For minds that have joined in Love<br />
can in no way be separate,<br />
one from another.</p>

<p>Fail not to dance, oh holy Son of God!<br />
Know you not what comes to pass?</p>

<p>The crucifixion is past,<br />
the resurrection completed,<br />
and ascension now descends upon us<br />
as a gentle dove,<br />
lifting us to the abode<br />
of the One who is but Love!</p>

<p>Forget you not to dance<br />
with every breath you breathe,<br />
for Love waits upon your welcome,<br />
and desires to be heard<br />
with every spoken word!</p>

<p><em>You</em> are the one sent forth from God!<br />
<em>You</em> are the one<br />
in whom He remains<br />
eternally well pleased!<br />
<em>You</em> are the one in whom I live,<br />
and reveal myself to the world!<br />
<em>You</em>, precious friend,<br />
you are as I AM!</p>

<p>In your joyousness<br />
is my laughter heard.<br />
In your giving<br />
am I received.</p>

<p>Dance you therefore with passion,<br />
not for the things of the world,<br />
but for that which alone is Real<br />
and cannot be taken from us.</p>

<p>Because Light<br />
is reborn in <em>you</em>,<br />
your brothers and sisters rejoice!<br />
You have become their salvation<br />
and they, yours.<br />
Their gratitude is joined with mine,<br />
and our voices are raised as one:<br />
“God <em>is</em>!”</p>

<p>The ancient melody is heard,<br />
the sacred and happy dance enjoined.<br />
Because we dance,<br />
we <em>do</em> know what comes to pass.<br />
We are the bringers of Heaven to Earth,<br />
that the things of the world<br />
might be forgotten,<br />
and the purpose of time<br />
might be completed.</p>

<p>The translation<br />
of a brief and harmless dream<br />
is finished,<br />
and all things are quietly returned.</p>

<p>The Sonship is remembered as One<br />
and the first, <em>is</em> first,<br />
eternally.</p>

<p>The field of obstacles<br />
through which the dreamer stumbles<br />
are but various symbols<br />
of the one thing<br />
he seems to have created in error.<br />
For appearances <em>are</em> error<br />
and nothing more.</p>

<p>I have often said –<br />
in many ways<br />
and through many channels –<br />
that there is but one lesson<br />
you need learn:</p>

<p class="indent">There is nothing outside you.</p>

<p>As with all expressions of wisdom,<br />
this statement is true<br />
at many levels.</p>

<p>Levels appear to exist<br />
as long as the dream seems to remain.<br />
Because you are awake,<br />
the idea of levels<br />
no longer pertains to you.</p>

<p>Therefore,<br />
the “secret” of this work<br />
is now revealed;<br />
it is given to those<br />
who are the teachers of God,<br />
for only they will truly<br />
and clearly<br />
understand it.</p>

<p>In knowing that they<br />
do understand it,<br />
they will know they have received<br />
the “sign from Heaven”<br />
I once promised them.<br />
Now<br />
they are free<br />
to take up their cross<br />
and follow me,<br />
for where I have gone<br />
they now can come.<br />
And the whole thought structure<br />
of the world<br />
has been reversed in them.</p>

<p>Because it is completed in them,<br />
it shall quickly be completed<br />
in the entire Sonship.<br />
This are they certain of,<br />
and our voices <em>are</em> raised as one.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>All things perceived<br />
arise only within the mind.<br />
Because all minds are joined,<br />
whatever is perceived has arisen<br />
in <em>one</em> mind,<br />
shared equally by all.</p>

<p>To say “all minds are joined”<br />
is to say only that there is one mind,<br />
and the things of Heaven and Earth<br />
arise<br />
and pass away<br />
within it.</p>

<p>You have learned<br />
that the body’s senses<br />
have led you to believe<br />
that everything<br />
beyond the boundary<br />
of the body<br />
is outside you.<br />
But you have recognized<br />
that <em>this cannot be true.</em></p>

<p>It has always made sense to you<br />
that your thoughts are not outside you.<br />
It has required great courage<br />
to learn the truth<br />
that your brother’s or sister’s thought<br />
is <em>also not outside you.</em></p>

<p>Until recently,<br />
you have remained fearful<br />
of taking the next logical step.<br />
While just a few traces of guilt remained<br />
you have feared what you perceived<br />
as an overwhelming responsibility.</p>

<p>But because the Father<br />
has taken the final step for you,<br />
you abide in the perfect safety<br />
where the next step<br />
is no longer fearful.</p>

<p>I have said that the Holy Spirit<br />
never teaches you<br />
what you are still<br />
fearful of learning.<br />
Because of this, two things follow.</p>

<p>First:<br />
Before you chose<br />
to be awake in me,<br />
it appeared that a prayer<br />
could fail to be answered.<br />
This was because you feared<br />
receiving the answer,<br />
and so it was not given you.<br />
But what you were willing to receive<br />
always <em>was</em> given.</p>

<p>Now,<br />
because you are willing<br />
to receive all,<br />
all <em>is</em> given you.<br />
Yet,<br />
because your eyes are open,<br />
you no longer pray<br />
“in vain.”<br />
This means only<br />
that you have gone beyond<br />
the childish prayers for those things<br />
you once believed you needed<br />
to save you<br />
from what you thought you feared.<br />
Because fear is gone,<br />
childish prayer has vanished.</p>

<p>Awake in our Remembrance,<br />
you have learned to pray<br />
only for the Atonement of the Sonship,<br />
and have extended to me<br />
your willingness to join with me<br />
in answering the only true prayer.</p>

<p>This has required<br />
the re-learning of trust,<br />
and trust is the inevitable fruit<br />
of the forgiveness<br />
you have extended to the world,<br />
of which you are a worthy part.</p>

<p>This willingness<br />
has given me permission<br />
to dismantle the “mansions”<br />
you had made in error;<br />
every teacher of God<br />
has faced crucifixion.</p>

<p>Through forgiveness,<br />
and mastery<br />
of the keys to the Kingdom,<br />
you have passed through<br />
the eye of the needle<br />
to join me in the resurrection.<br />
All things <em>have</em> been made new again!</p>

<p>Second:<br />
Because you are now taking<br />
the next step,<br />
it must mean that the fear<br />
which had kept<br />
what you prayed for from you<br />
is <em>no longer present.</em></p>

<p>This can only mean<br />
that my promise has been kept:<br />
I have given you my strength<br />
until yours has become<br />
as certain as mine.<br />
Because you know that I live in you,<br />
your strength <em>is</em> as certain as mine,<br />
and the next step<br />
we can now take together.</p>

<p>For those who have chosen<br />
to learn this curriculum<br />
through my <em>Course in Miracles,</em><br />
you will clearly remember<br />
that it was not designed<br />
to answer every question<br />
a teacher of God might have.<br />
It could not do so,<br />
being only a teaching device<br />
aimed at a specific goal:<br />
peace.</p>

<p>Peace is the necessary foundation<br />
from which the teacher of God<br />
moves to complete the Atonement<br />
on Earth,<br />
<em>as it is already completed in Heaven.</em></p>

<p>Now<br />
are we ready<br />
to take the necessary step,<br />
and accept the final meaning<br />
of the one lesson:</p>

<p class="indent">There is nothing outside you.</p>

<p>You are your brother’s keeper<br />
because you <em>are</em> your brother.</p>

<p>The translation<br />
of the unhappy dream of separation<br />
into the final,<br />
happy dream –<br />
the final manifestation in time –<br />
requires that it be accomplished<br />
<em>through you.</em></p>

<p>Those of you<br />
who understand clearly<br />
the meaning of this work<br />
are those in whom all preparation<br />
is completed.<br />
You have learned<br />
that the purpose of your life<br />
is <em>exactly the same as was mine,</em><br />
to demonstrate that, with God,<br />
all things are not simply possible,<br />
but inevitable.</p>

<p>You are now ready<br />
to become a <em>living demonstration</em><br />
of <em>complete mastery</em>.</p>

<p>Because all resistance is gone<br />
(for what is ego but this?),<br />
the discipline necessary<br />
for the completion of your demonstration<br />
is as an “easy yoke.”<br />
It is a discipline<br />
that must joyfully touch<br />
upon every aspect of your life.</p>

<p>It is through you<br />
that the simple and natural righteousness<br />
of God’s “laws”<br />
can be demonstrated.</p>

<p>Mastery in <em>every</em> aspect<br />
of the life given unto you<br />
is the only way you can teach<br />
your brother and your sister<br />
that God <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>This means that now<br />
we look together<br />
beyond the mind’s tendency<br />
to separate itself from the world<br />
by looking upon aspects of life<br />
not yet mastered,<br />
and decreeing them to be simply illusions.<br />
While this is true,<br />
it is not appropriate to conclude<br />
that they be left untransformed.</p>

<p>To those with ears to hear:<br />
It is simply not possible to transcend<br />
what you refuse to acknowledge<br />
and embrace.<br />
Denial is but the ploy of ego<br />
to ensure that your Self<br />
remains imprisoned,<br />
and <em>the ego</em> remains enthroned.</p>

<p>Again I ask of you:</p>

<p class="indent">What do you <strong>want</strong>, truly?</p>
