    <p class="lesson-header">If I defend myself, I am attacked.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Who would defend himself unless he thought he was attacked,
that the attack is real, and that his own defense can save himself? And
herein lies the folly of defense—it gives illusions full reality and
then attempts to handle them as real. It adds illusions to illusions,
thus making correction doubly difficult.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> And it is this you do when you attempt to plan the future,
activate the past, or organize the present as you wish. You operate from
the belief you must protect yourself from what is happening because it
must contain what threatens you. A sense of threat is an acknowledgment
of an inherent weakness, a belief that there is danger which has power
to call on you to make appropriate defense.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> The world is based on this insane belief. And all its
structures, all its thoughts and doubts, its penalties and heavy
armaments, its legal definitions and its codes, its ethics and its
leaders and its gods, all serve but to preserve its sense of threat. For
no one walks the world in armature but must have terror striking at his
heart.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Defense is frightening. It stems from fear, increasing fear
as each defense is made. You think it offers safety. Yet it speaks of
fear made real and terror justified. Is it not strange you do not pause
to ask, as you elaborate your plans and make your armor thicker and your
locks more tight, what you defend, and how, and against what?</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Let us consider first what you defend. It must be something
that is very weak and easily assaulted. It must be something made easy
prey, unable to protect itself, and needing your defense. What but the
body has such frailty that constant care and watchful, deep concern are
needful to protect its little life? What but the body falters and must
fail to serve the Son of God as worthy host?</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> Yet it is not the body that can fear, nor be a thing to
fear. It has no needs but those which you assign to it. It needs no
complicated structures of defense, no health-inducing medicine, no care,
and no concern at all. Defend its life, or give it gifts to make it
beautiful or walls to make it safe, and you but say your home is open to
the thief of time, corruptible and crumbling, so unsafe it must be
guarded with your very life.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> Is not this picture fearful? Can you be at peace with such
a concept of your home? Yet what endowed the body with the right to
serve you thus except your own belief? It is your mind which gave the
body all the functions that you see in it and set its value far beyond a
little pile of dust and water. Who would make defense of something that
he recognized as this?</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> The body is in need of no defense. This cannot be too often
emphasized. It will be strong and healthy if the mind does not abuse it
by assigning it to roles it cannot fill, to purposes beyond its scope,
and to exalted aims which it cannot accomplish. Such attempts,
ridiculous yet deeply cherished, are the sources for the many mad
attacks you make upon it. For it seems to fail your hopes, your needs,
your values, and your dreams.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> The “self” that needs protection is not real. The body,
valueless and hardly worth the least defense, need merely be perceived
as quite apart from you, and it becomes a healthy, serviceable
instrument through which the mind can operate until its usefulness is
over. Who would want to keep it when its usefulness is done?</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> Defend the body, and you have attacked your mind. For you
have seen in it the faults, the weaknesses, the limits, and the lacks
from which you think the body must be saved. You will not see the mind
as separate from bodily conditions. And you will impose upon the body
all the pain that comes from the conception of the mind as limited and
fragile, and apart from other minds and separate from its Source.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> These are the thoughts in need of healing, and the body
will respond with health when they have been corrected and replaced with
truth. This is the body’s only real defense. Yet is this where you look
for its defense? You offer it protection of a kind from which it gains
no benefit at all but merely adds to your distress of mind. You do not
heal but merely take away the hope of healing, for you fail to see where
hope must lie if it be meaningful.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> A healed mind does not plan. It carries out the plans
which it receives through listening to Wisdom that is not its own. It
waits until it has been taught what should be done and then proceeds to
do it. It does not depend upon itself for anything except its adequacy
to fulfill the plans assigned to it. It is secure in certainty that
obstacles cannot impede its progress to accomplishment of any goal which
serves the greater plan established for the good of everyone.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> A healed mind is relieved from the belief that it must
plan, although it cannot know the outcome which is best, the means by
which it is achieved, nor how to recognize the problem that the plan is
made to solve. It must misuse the body in its plans until it recognizes
this is so. But when it has accepted this as true, then is it healed and
lets the body go.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup> Enslavement of the body to the plans the unhealed mind
sets up to save itself must make the body sick. It is not free to be a
means of helping in a plan which far exceeds its own protection and
which needs its service for a little while. In this capacity is health
assured. For everything the mind employs for this will function
flawlessly and with the strength that has been given it and cannot fail.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup> It is, perhaps, not easy to perceive that self-initiated
plans are but defenses with the purpose all of them were made to
realize. They are the means by which a frightened mind would undertake
its own protection at the cost of truth. This is not difficult to
realize in some forms which these self-deceptions take, for the denial
of reality is very obvious. Yet planning is not often recognized as a
defense.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup> The mind engaged in planning for itself is occupied in
setting up control of future happenings. It does not think that it will
be provided for unless it makes its own provisions. Time becomes a
future emphasis to be controlled by learning and experience obtained
from past events and previous beliefs. It overlooks the present, for it
rests on the idea the past has taught enough to let the mind direct its
future course.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup> The mind that plans is thus refusing to allow for change.
What it has learned before becomes the basis for its future goals. Its
past experience directs its choice of what will happen. And it does not
see that here and now is everything it needs to guarantee a future quite
unlike the past without a continuity of any old ideas and sick beliefs.
Anticipation plays no part at all, for present confidence directs the
way.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup> Defenses are the plans you undertake to make against the
truth. Their aim is to select what you approve and disregard what you
consider incompatible with your beliefs of your reality. Yet what
remains is meaningless indeed. For it is your reality which is the
“threat” that your defenses would attack, obscure, and take apart and
crucify.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup> What could you not accept if you but knew that everything
that happens, all events, past, present, and to come, are gently planned
by One Whose only purpose is your good? Perhaps you have misunderstood
His plan, for He would never offer pain to you. But your defenses did
not let you see His loving blessing shine in every step you ever took.
While you made plans for death, He led you gently to eternal life.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup> Your present trust in Him is the defense which promises a
future undisturbed, without a trace of sorrow and with joy which
constantly increases as this life becomes a holy instant, set in time
but heeding only immortality. Let no defenses but your present trust
direct the future, and this life becomes a meaningful encounter with the
truth that only your defenses would conceal.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup> Without defenses, you become a light which Heaven
gratefully acknowledges to be its own. And it will lead you on in ways
appointed for your happiness according to the ancient plan begun when
time was born. Your followers will join their light with yours, and it
will be increased until the world is lighted up with joy. And gladly
will our brothers lay aside their cumbersome defenses which availed them
nothing and could only terrify.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup> We will anticipate that time today with present
confidence, for this is part of what was planned for us. We will be sure
that everything we need is given us for our accomplishment of this
today. We make no plans for how it will be done but realize that our
defenselessness is all that is required for the truth to dawn upon our
minds with certainty.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup> For 15 minutes twice today, we rest from senseless
planning and from every thought which blocks the truth from entering our
minds. Today we will receive instead of plan, that we may give instead
of organize. And we are given truly, as we say:</p>

<p><sup>24</sup> <em>If I defend myself, I am attacked.<br />
But in defenselessness, I will be strong,<br />
And I will learn what my defenses hide</em>.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup> Nothing but that. If there are plans to make, you will be
told of them. They may not be the plans you thought were needed nor
indeed the answers to the problems which you thought confronted you. But
they are answers to another kind of question which remains unanswered
yet in need of answering until the Answer comes to you at last.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup> All your defenses have been aimed at not receiving what
you will receive today. And in the light and joy of simple truth, you
will but wonder why you ever thought that you must be defended from
release. Heaven asks nothing. It is hell that makes extravagant demands
for sacrifice. You give up nothing in these times today when undefended
you present yourself to your Creator as you really are.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup> He has remembered you. Today we will remember Him. For
this is Eastertime in your salvation. And you rise again from what was
seeming death and hopelessness. Now is the light of hope reborn in you,
for now you come without defense to learn the part for you within the
plan of God. What little plans or magical beliefs can still have value
when you have received your function from the Voice of God Himself?</p>

<p><sup>28</sup> Try not to shape this day as you believe would benefit you
most. For you cannot conceive of all the happiness that comes to you
without your planning. Learn today. And all the world will take this
giant stride and celebrate your Eastertime with you. Throughout the day,
as foolish little things appear to raise defensiveness in you and tempt
you to engage in weaving plans, remind yourself this is a special day
for learning, and acknowledge it with this:</p>

<p><sup>29</sup> <em>This is my Eastertime. And I would keep<br />
It holy. I will not defend myself,<br />
Because the Son of God needs no defense<br />
Against the truth of his reality</em>.</p>
