    <p>19.1 There was no evil intent in the creation of the body as a learning
device, and as a learning device it was perfectly created. The problem
lies in what you have, in your forgetfulness, made of the body. Only
from thinking of the body as yourself did ideas of glorifying the body
arise. To glorify a learning device makes no sense. And yet in creating
the perfect device from which you could experience separation, all such
problems were anticipated and corrective devices created alongside them.
You could not fully experience separation without a sense of self as
separate, and you could not fully experience anything without your free
will. A separate self with a free will operating in an external world,
as well as a spirit self desiring the experience of separation, would
naturally lead to a situation where the whole range of experiences
available to a separate being would exist.</p>

<p>19.2 The complex set of criteria needed to create a world of separation
was, in the instant of creation, anticipated and provided in a form
consistent with creation’s laws. While this world was created with love,
as all of creation was, it was also created to provide the desired
experience. Thus was fear born, for a separate self is a fearful self by
its nature. How could it not be?</p>

<p>19.3 You who have grown weary of this experience rejoice, for you can
choose a new experience. Your free will has not been taken from you, nor
has the power of creation abandoned you. Within creation’s own laws does
the solution rest.</p>

<p>19.4 The solution lies in transformation, and that is why you are still
needed here. Beneath the world of illusion that you have made to glorify
the separated self lies the world that was created for your learning,
and that so exists in truth. It is not the only world by any means, but
it is still heaven because heaven must be where you are. A wholehearted
choice to abandon all ideas of glorifying the separated self and to let
the world be what it is will begin the transformation. This requires the
first unification, the unification of mind and heart, after which
unification with God is naturally returned to your awareness, for this
unification returns you to the Christ in you and the one mind united
with God which you have never left. Creation’s power then returns to you
to help all the separated ones remember union.</p>

<p>19.5 Although this all may sound like science fiction to you, realize
that you accept much in all areas of your life, from that of religion to
science itself, that sounds like fiction. You are not, however, expected
to believe all I have told you on faith alone. Experience is needed to
change your beliefs and to place your faith securely in them. The first
step in leading you to experience of another kind is your willingness to
accept that you are here to learn, and that your body can provide the
means.</p>

<p>19.6 Your saving grace is that even a separated self yearns for union
and knowledge of its Creator. Thus along with this yearning was a means
provided for its fulfillment, and with this fulfillment lies the end of
the separation.</p>

<p>19.7 I was part of this means, but only part. Fulfillment can be
provided by each and every one of your brothers and sisters, for in each
is the Christ available to be seen and experienced as it was from me. It
is in your holy relationships that union can be found and experienced,
and thus from these that you fuel your desire for union with all and for
knowledge of your Creator. This yearning must but be a pure
yearning—untainted by fear and judgment and approached with
wholeheartedness—for it to be fulfilled. It is not the means that are
lacking but the wholehearted desire.</p>

<p>19.8 Let me speak briefly of the role I played so that you can better
understand the role that waits for you. I came in the fulfillment of
scripture. All this really means is that a certain community had been
led to expect my arrival. They awaited me with expectation and so found
in me what they hoped to find. What my brothers and sisters saw in me
allowed me to be who I was, even while in human form. I tell you truly
if you were to see any of your brothers and sisters today as those who
awaited my birth saw me, they too would remember who they are. This is
the role I ask you to accept so that you can provide for others what was
provided for me.</p>

<p>19.9 Each one of your brothers and sisters is as holy as I and as
beloved to God. Can you not witness to their belovedness as those long
ago witnessed to mine? You have not been able to do this thus far
because you have desired specialness for yourself and a few others
rather than belovedness for all. But now, perhaps, you are ready.</p>

<p>19.10 The separated self cannot relearn unity except through union.
Here, union is achieved in relationship. To see your brothers and
sisters as those of long ago saw me is the way to achieve relationship
of the highest order and relearn communion, the language of the heart.
This is why you have been asked to experience the spirit of your
brothers and sisters rather than simply relating to their bodies as you
always have. I was not seen as a body by those who believed in me,
although I had a body to help me learn just as you do.</p>

<p>19.11 My testimony witnessed to your arrival just as the scriptures
witnessed to mine. Even while some of my words were distorted or
misinterpreted, you can still revisit them and see that this is so. I
did not proclaim myself to be above or different from the rest, but
called each of you brother and sister and reminded you of our Father’s
love and of our union with Him.</p>

<p>19.12 Your belief in your brothers and sisters will not be total,
however, without the reunion of mind and heart that produces the state
of wholeheartedness.  This state was not achieved at all times by all
those who believed in me— and perfection is not asked of you. As can be
clearly seen from the records left to you, the apostles did not, in
fact, achieve this state during my lifetime, for they looked at me as
different and looked to me for power. Only after my resurrection did the
Holy Spirit come upon them and reveal their own power to them by uniting
mind and heart with belief. They were then reunited with me as they were
united with the Christ. You thus must learn to see yourself as you see
your brothers and sisters, and place your belief not in differences but
in sameness.</p>

<p>19.13 In order to do this there is still one more layer to the
unification of thought, and this brings up another reason for our
reliance on the heart. Thought, as you know it, is an aspect of duality.
It cannot be otherwise in your separated state. You must think in terms
of “I” and “them,” “death and life,” “good and evil.” This is thought.
Thought occurs in words, and words separate. It is only in combining
mind and heart with a focus on letting the heart lead that love can be
combined with thought in such a way as to actually transcend thought as
you know it. This transcendence is a function of wholeheartedness.</p>

<p>19.14 This is, in essence, why the greatest thinkers have not been able
to decipher the riddle, the mystery, of the divine, and why they
conclude that God is unknowable. God is knowable from within the mystery
of non-duality itself.  It would be impossible for you to be a being
that can yearn for knowledge of your Creator without this knowledge
being available. In creation, all needs are fulfilled the instant they
become needs, which is why there are no needs.  If everything you need
has been provided, having needs makes no sense.</p>

<p>19.15 Philosophy applies thought to mystery and that is why philosophy
becomes such a muddle of words. It is difficult for you to accept that
what you most need to know cannot be achieved through the same methods
you have used in order to know about other things. And, increasingly,
you are willing to exchange experience for second-hand knowledge and to
believe you can come to know through the experiences of others. Yet, in
the case of coming to know what lies before you now—coming to know your
own Self— it is obvious that another’s experience will not bring this
knowledge to you, not even my experience. If this were so, all of those
who read of my life and words would have learned what I learned from my
experience. While many have learned much of others, this type of
learning is but a starting point, a gateway to experience.</p>

<p>19.16 To think without thought or know without words are ideas quite
foreign to you, and truly, while you remain here, even experiences
beyond thoughts and words you will apply word and thought to. Yet love
has often brought you close to a “thought-less” and “word-less” state of
being, and it can do so again. As you join with your own Self in unity,
all that in love you have created and received returns to its home in
you, and leaves you in a state of love in which the wordless and
formless is very near.</p>

<p>19.17 Your only concept of oneness is of a single form, a single entity.
There is either one chair or two. One table or four. Your emphasis has
been on quantity, and one is seen as less than any other number. Yet, on
the other hand, when only one of anything exists it is highly prized.
God is thus “God” due, at least in part, to what you view as His
singularity. You view those who worship many gods as primitive, although
those who believe in a god synonymous with creation are closer to a true
picture of God than those who view God as a solitary figure. Still,
oneness and unity go together, the unity of creation being part of the
oneness of God, and the oneness of God part of the unity of creation. A
mind trained by separation can have no concept of this, as all concepts
are born from the mind’s separate thoughts. Yet this same mind could
still conceive of a creator. A mind that can conceive of a creator
combined with a heart that yearns for knowledge of, and union with, that
creator, can bypass the need for the separate thoughts of the separated
one’s thought system. But you must be trained to do this. Thus your
training begins. And begins with prayer.</p>

<p>19.18 As was said in the beginning, praying is asking. You but asked for
your separated state and it was made so. Now you need to but ask for
unity to return for it to be so. The condition or state of being from
which you ask is what is in need of adjustment and thus of training
before you can be aware of the answer you will receive. It is clear you
can ask for what you know not. This is not the problem. The problem is
in who is doing the asking.  The separated self, while capable of
asking, is hardly capable of believing in or accepting the response. It
is this non-belief in a response that makes it capable of asking. Now
that you are beginning to shed the concept of the separate self and to
believe in the possibility of response, you will find yourself more
afraid to ask. All your asking or prayer awaits is but your belief in
the love without fear that has always responded.</p>

<p>19.19 Out of the deepest, darkest chaos of your mind comes the
possibility of light. It is a bit like traveling backward, or the review
of life that some experience after death. In order to remember unity you
must, in a sense, travel back to it, undoing as you go all you have
learned since last you knew it, so all that remains is love. This
undoing, or atonement, has begun—and once begun is unstoppable and thus
already inevitably accomplished.</p>

<p>19.20 My brothers and sisters in Christ, do not become impatient now. We
are on the home stretch and all you long for is nearer than ever before.
To talk of going “back” will undoubtedly make you feel impatient, but
this is not a going back that will in any way resemble the “going back”
that you have tried to do before. While it is, in a sense, a request to
review your life, it is the last such review that will be required
before letting the past go completely. All your previous attempts to go
back have been like attempts to pay a debt that will never go away. This
going back will leave you debt free and thus free in truth.</p>

<p>19.21 This going back is the journey without distance. You need not go
in search of it, and in truth, cannot, for the past does not abide in
you. What you need rather do is strive for a place of stillness from
which what needs review can arise as if it were a reflection arising
from a deep pool. Here what is in need of healing will but briefly come
to the surface and leave the hidden depths where light could not reach
it and healing could not come. What comes forth for healing needs but a
nod of love from your heart, a passing glance of compassion, the merest
moment of reflection, before it will dissipate and show a new
reflection.</p>

<p>19.22 This going back is, in reality, more in the way of reflection than
review, although if you were to think of this as a re-viewing of your
self, you would be quite accurate. It is like unto the final judgment as
it has been described, a sorting of the real from the unreal, of truth
from illusion. Despite the similarity between what this will call forth
and the description of the final judgment, judgment is not the means or
end of this reckoning.</p>

<p>19.23 The loftiest aim of which you are currently capable is that of
changing your perception. Although our ultimate goal is to move beyond
perception to knowledge, a first step in doing this is changing your
means of perception to that of right-mindedness. Your willingness to
accept me as your teacher will help you to accept my sight as your own
and thus to be right-minded.  The way you have perceived of yourself and
your world until now has not been right-minded, and you are beginning to
realize this. Thus it is now appropriate for the realization to come to
you that your mind, and your perception, can be changed. This is
necessary before you can look back in a new way and not simply cover the
same ground you have covered a million times, seeing causes for
recriminations, blame, and guilt. Looking back in judgment is not what
is required here. Only the opposite will advance our aim of uniting mind
and heart.</p>

<p>19.24 The Holy Spirit exists in your right mind, and is the bridge to
exchanging perception for knowledge. Knowledge is light, and the only
light in which you can truly see. You will not truly desire to unite
your mind and heart in wholeheartedness until you see clearly. One
purpose of the distinctions you have made between mind and heart are
their ability to keep one part of yourself blameless. Whatever happens,
your divided notion of yourself allows you to both protect and conceal.
Fault always lies elsewhere. The guiltless part of you is always free to
redeem the guilt-filled self. This idea of self-redemption has long been
a culprit that has kept union, even with your own Self, undesirable to
you. The concept that in oneness there is no need for blame or guilt or
even for redemption is inconceivable to the separate mind. But not to
the heart.</p>
