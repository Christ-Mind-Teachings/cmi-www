    <p>14.1 The purpose of the life you share here with your brothers and your
sisters has been to challenge God’s creation. Now your united purpose
must change to that of remembering who you are within God’s creation,
rather than in the world that you have made. Think but a minute of this,
and you will begin to see the enormity of the difference in these two
purposes.</p>

<p>14.2 Is it not true that you have made an enemy of creation? Do you feel
part of it and at one with all within it? If not, you have made yourself
creation’s enemy. You seek to be different from all the rest, and in
this seeking proclaim that one part of creation is better than another
part. You thus seek to fragment creation as you have fragmented your own
self. And from the vantage point you have established in which you view
yourself as the epitome of God’s creation, you see the rest of creation
as being meant to serve your ends. And since your end or goal is that of
separation and being different from all the rest, this is the goal you
ask creation to bow down to, a goal that never can be achieved any more
than can your separation from what you think is unlike you.</p>

<p>14.3 You cannot have feelings of superiority and not an enemy make. The
same occurs when you would make yourself inferior, and you are always
making for yourself a place at one of these extremes. And all this
effort and conflict arises simply from your insistence upon being
separate. He who is your enemy you cannot help but be at war with. Where
there is war there can be no peace. War is not simply the existence of
external activity.  External activity is but the effect of a cause that
remains internal, and all war is but war upon yourself.</p>

<p>14.4 Do you not see how your notion of heaven being an attainment you
can reach only after death fits your goal of separation? If your belief
in heaven were true, your challenge to creation would be real and only
your death would prove the victor. For if after death your creator God
provided you with a paradise not of this world, a separate place to
honor your specialness and separation from all else that He created,
then would you be vindicated and the purpose of your war made holy. You
would be proven right and creation wrong.</p>

<p>14.5 Would this make sense? What creator would create a world in which
the highest achievement of the life upon it would be to leave it in
order to gain life? What creator would create a world not meant to exist
in harmony?  Harmony is life. What creator would create a temporary life
and hold eternal life as a reward for death?</p>

<p>14.6 If you can see the senselessness of a creator and a creation such
as this and still believe in it, then you must believe in a god who is
insane. You— who pride yourself on reason and practicality—think if a
creation such as this could contain any reason whatsoever. Why then do
you believe in it?</p>

<p>14.7 You who have made a god of reason and of intellect, think carefully
now of what your reason and your intellect have made for you. How
terrible would it really be to realize that although you have tried
mightily, a creation such as this cannot be made to make any sense at
all? Those who have turned their backs on God and refused to believe in
such nonsense have simply refused to make reason try to fit the
unfitable without seeing that an alternative exists.</p>

<p>14.8 You are not asked to believe the unbelievable, or to disregard all
that reason would say to you. Only the opposite is true. You are asked
rather to give up the laws of chaos for the laws of reason. The laws of
illusion for the laws of truth.</p>

<p>14.9 Think you not that reason opposes love, for love gives reason its
foundation. The foundation of your insane world is fear. The foundation
of Heaven, your true home, is love. The same world based upon these
different foundations could not help but look quite different.</p>

<p>14.10 Your ideas of love, however, fit your goal of separation as neatly
and conveniently as does your idea of heaven. For what you require of
love is that it set you apart and make you special. Much more is
demanded of those you love than of any of your other brothers and
sisters. The more that is required is all to feed your idea of your own
specialness. You look for constant verifi- cation that this one you love
loves you in return, and if this attention is not provided you feel you
have cause for claiming wounds that cannot be healed and reparations
that cannot be paid. You thus hold the one you love the most in the
greatest bondage, and call that bondage a relationship.</p>

<p>14.11 This can be most clearly seen in relationships that were once
“everything” to you and have since failed you. This can be a memory of
any relationship, and each of you has one. It can be of parent and
child, of best friends, of a marriage or a partnership, or even that of
a mentor or student.  Whatever the relationship’s configuration, it was
one that truly brought you joy. Within it you were happy and felt as if
you needed nothing more than this. It was a relationship so intense that
at its peak you would have begun to see its continuation without change
as the major goal of your life. Without it, life would not be worth
living, and so it was necessary to retain it at all cost.</p>

<p>14.12 This is a classic example that reveals much to you about yourself
and the world you have made if you are but willing to look at it with
eyes that truly see. It is the magnifying glass that will allow you to
see your world in all its mad confusion. For what caused you such great
joy seemed to come at the cost of pain and to leave you more alone and
comfortless than before. How could this be said of love? And how could
it have failed you so? And how, if it were real—as it surely felt as if
it was—could it prove anything but that love is no answer, and surely
not for you?</p>

<p>14.13 We must begin with what is obvious, a simple point that some of
you have denied and that some of you could not. What makes this
relationship stand out in your mind and feel so painful in your memory
of it is that it was quite real in a way that is different from your
relationships before or since.  No other relationship affected you in
such a way. Never were you more sure of a relationship’s value to you.
Anything that could make you feel so joyous, so safe and warm and loved,
could not help but hold a value quite beyond compare. In this you were
correct. It was no illusion that caused you to feel this way. This was
not the love that passes for love in this world, but something else
entirely. For at least one brief moment, this was true love, for nothing
but love can be the cause of joy, nor offer a haven of safety in an
insane world.</p>

<p>14.14 It is your response to love that concerns us now, for the return
of love is coming and you do not want to make the same response again.</p>

<p>14.15 Everything that you consider valuable you want to keep. This makes
perfect sense to you because the foundation of your world is fear. Were
the foundation of your world love, everything that you consider valuable
you could not wait to share. Perhaps you think the desire to keep things
for yourself stems from something other than fear. You might call this
desire pride or security, or even accept that it is vanity, before you
would call it fear.  But fear is what it is.</p>

<p>14.16 Only fear breeds the feelings of lack that stand with it, the
cornerstone of the foundation of your separate world. You do not realize
that you have created a universe for yourself, a universe that you are
required to maintain, and that without your effort would dissolve. This
universe is yourself and you are everything in it. Do you not believe
that were you to perish something quite unique would be lost to the
world? You are alone and irreplaceable: one of a kind. Within you lie
all that you would hope to contribute and create. Within the actions and
interactions of your lifetime lie all the effects you would hope to have
on what remains here. Without you, the people and the events that you
would influence, would behave quite differently and bring about
different results than are somehow meant to occur.  Although you know
not your purpose, at least a part of you believes that this is true, for
there must be some reason for your existence—although you cannot quite
imagine what that reason might be. You must be meant to be because you
are, and you cannot fathom that you would exist at all if there were not
a reason for you to do so.</p>

<p>14.17 Is this not a description of a universe? What is a universe but
itself and everything in it? Nothing would seem to exist outside of it,
and so it must be unique. Everything that would happen within the
universe would depend upon it.</p>

<p>14.18 You think that you are quite aware of your small space within the
universe, and that it is foolishness to say that you think otherwise.
Yet, since only what you know is part of your universe, do you not see
that it depends on you, and if it depends on you that it is you? Only
what you are aware of exists in the universe that is you. Only what
happens to you affects your universe. Your universe is completely
different than anyone else’s and completely self-contained. The laws of
your universe are for the maintenance of your body, because without it
you would not exist. And when you cease to exist, so does your universe.
The lights will be turned out upon it and it will be no more.</p>

<p>14.19 What a big job you have assigned yourself! It is no small wonder
that you live in fear when so much is dependent upon you. And no wonder
that when you find a respite, a place of rest and beauty and of love,
you want to claim it for your own lest it get away! It too must be
maintained within your universe, or you will know it not and its
benefits will escape and be lost to you. You wish that you could join
with it and make it one with you, but since you know not that this can
be done or how to do it, you try to accomplish the “next best thing” and
keep it close to you, a twin universe still existing separately, but
close enough that you can gaze upon it and feel the benefit of its
warmth because of its proximity. More than this you cannot do, but still
you try. With chains you would bind this separate universe to your own,
for as long as it maintains its autonomy, which it must, even its
nearness is not enough. And so what you attempt next is an exchange of
sorts. Like two countries, one rich in oil, another in grain, you set up
dependencies that will keep you linked. Some of you do this quite
obviously, and over years and years create a web of intricate design, a
snare or trap that seems impossible to dismantle because of its
interconnections. Others experience this plan of entrapment solely in
their mind as they plot and plan for what they never have the
opportunity to put into place. Still others are more coy in their
design, and dress it up to look like sacrifice and gifts given, but all
with the same purpose in mind. What none realize is that fear has
replaced love.</p>

<p>14.20 Some may realize that they are afraid of losing love, and even
speak of it and try to alleviate the fear with official commitments,
pledges and promises made. Others may deny their fear, and say they
trust in what they have and the faithfulness of the one they love. Fewer
than these are those who do not need to voice their faith and trust, for
their feelings remain strong despite their fear. For even those who fear
no deception must remain afraid of the great deceiver. Whether they call
it life or death, it is still the same.  It is the chance that cannot be
foreseen but is always there: death may take their loved one
prematurely, and if not prematurely certainly eventually.</p>

<p>14.21 And all of these, those who would admit to fear, and those who
would not, would still believe that love exists despite fear’s claim
upon it, and think that they are lucky to have found a love to shield
them for a little while from all the other things they fear. And yet the
greatest fear of all is that of loss of love. You who have given
everything to be alone and separate fear most of all that which you have
given everything to attain. For what is loss of love but confirmation of
your separate state? What is loss of love but being left alone?</p>

<p>14.22 Loss of love comes from only one source. Call it fear or call it
separation but it is still the same. For in your separated state you ask
that love make you special to someone else, and that one special to you.
You think this is what love is for, and so you make of it something it
is not and only call it love.</p>

<p>14.23 Heaven can only be made to seem to fit your goal of separation,
and the same is true of love. You cannot change what love is or what
heaven is. All that seems to make it change is the function or purpose
you would give it.  It is but you who gave heaven the purpose of giving
you something to look forward to, a reward for a life lived according to
your own rules, a reward to be gained by some and not by others, a
pinnacle of achievement that will prove your rightness and your success
after you are gone. Love you give the same purpose, but bid it do the
job of rewarding you here and now. It, like heaven, is your proof that
you are good and worthy, special and to be rewarded for your
specialness.</p>

<p>14.24 You have thus placed love and heaven together in a parody of
creation’s meaning of each. Yes, they go together, and this you know;
but the purpose of neither is what you have ascribed it to be. The
purpose you give each thing within your world is what makes it what it
is to you. And as each purpose you have ascribed to anything proceeds
from the foundation of fear that built your world, each purpose is as
senseless and as reversed from the truth as is the next.</p>

<p>14.25 This is why this Course cannot just talk of love and bring you any
closer to it than you are. While you realize not the purpose of anything
in truth, you cannot know love or your own Self.</p>

<p>14.26 While your purpose remains to make yourself and others special,
you will not put an end to the separation. And you cannot just let go of
your own specialness. For as long as you hold on to the specialness of
others you hold on to your own. There is no reason to hold on to
another’s specialness unless you hold onto your own. And what you give
to others you keep for yourself. Give another specialness, and you keep
it for yourself as well as see it in them instead of seeing their glory.
Specialness keeps them separate, and therefore susceptible to loss. How
can you lose what is one with you?  You cannot. You can only lose that
which is separate. And specialness does make separate.</p>

<p>14.27 This is the problem compounded in your “special” love
relationships of having experienced real specialness, which is not
specialness at all but glory. Your joining caused this, for each joining
brings you in touch with your brother. Each joining returns you to your
holy relationship with your brother, which is the only one you have in
truth. Only this relationship is real, and in it are included all
others. One does not discard or replace the other. What is real is
all-inclusive. What is unreal is nothing.</p>

<p>14.28 You who do not know how to trade your separated state for that of
union have still done so when you have loved freely and without fear. In
this state your memory returns to you of who you are, and you are
innocent and joyous and one with love itself. That this memory does not
last, and these feelings seem unsustainable, is the result only of that
which does discard and replace. As we have said before, there are but
two emotions. One is love, the other fear. Fear, through your own
choice, replaces and discards love. Fear is always strongest when you
value something that you feel may be threatened.  Love threatens most
your specialness. Before your conscious mind has any awareness of what
is happening, your memory of love, of innocence and of joy, threatens
your specialness, your ego, your separated self who quickly rushes in
with love’s replacement. Nothing but fear could take the memory of love
from you, or replace so quickly the glory that is your nature with the
specialness that is not.</p>

<p>14.29 You think love is what you value most, and so resist any notion
that what you view as love is not what you think it is. But as long as
you equate love with the special ones on whom you choose to bestow it,
you will know love not. What you will know is specialness, raised to the
level of the Almighty and set upon His throne in a crown of jewels.</p>

<p>14.30 In your world love has no meaning unless it is attached to a
particular thing. And as soon as love is attached to a particular,
love’s opposite is brought into existence. While you refuse to look upon
this simple fact, you have no hope of change, nor does your world. You
who think, “What harm can come of loving this one above all others?”
think again. For you are choosing not to love but to make special. And
you are choosing but to make love’s opposite real to you and those you
claim to love, as well as those you claim not to love.</p>

<p>14.31 Let us ask instead how loving all as one can bring harm? If you
love all the same, what loss is there to anyone, including the one you
would choose to make special? All that is lost is specialness. This is
the view of life you cannot imagine bringing about, or bringing joy in
its coming. But this is what you must begin to imagine if you desire to
accept love’s coming instead of to reject it once again. For your
refusal to give up specialness is your refusal of the Christ in you and
a refusal of love itself.</p>
