    <p>Now, we begin.</p>

<p>And indeed, once again, greetings unto you, beloved and holy and
only–begotten child of God. Listen well to this greeting.
Greetings onto <em>you, beloved</em> and <em>holy</em> and <em>only–begotten</em> child
of God. This is in truth, the truth of who you are. This is in reality
all that you can be.</p>

<p>For before the time when the first stars were set in the heavens,
already did you abide as your Father has created you to be. No, not as
the mind would show you yourself. There was not such a thing as what you
know as a body. There was not such a thing as a thought of temporality.
There was not the trace of the thought of birth, and therefore, no
concept or experience of what you would call death. In that ancient
beginning, before time is, already were you created <em>whole</em> and
<em>complete</em>, the perfect loving extension of the mind of God. And God is
but love. This being true, it is true <em>always</em>. There is not a moment in
time in which this truth is interrupted. There is not a moment in any of
your experience in which the real world ceases to be.</p>

<p>How, then, can it be that you find yourself seemingly constricted into the
space and volume of a physical body? It is very dense and often quite hard. How
is that you look out through physical eyes so <em>certain</em> that what they show you
is real? And certainly you can prove it to yourself. Just try to walk through
a wall and you will convince yourself that that wall is completely real, that
the body is who you are, that’s the way it is, and it cannot change. Taking
that conception into the mind, taking that perception <em>to be what is true</em>, you
teach yourself to deny the gentle voice given unto God to his and only
creation, you, and placed lovingly <em>within</em> from before the beginning of time.</p>

<p>That voice is with you still and always. But it requires, if you would hear,
a willingness to surrender every perception you’ve ever believed about yourself
or about the world, and that very act feels like total insanity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What will happen to me if I give up my belief that that wall is real?
What will happen to me if I give up all the perceptions that I know are
etched in stone and I must act from them in order to survive in this
world that I certainly didn’t make?  After all, I came into it as an
accident born of my parents’ passion. I simply found myself here, and
this is the way that I am.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does seem absurd to give up such deeply rooted perceptions and
beliefs <em>and experiences</em> that you believe have helped you to survive in
order to entertain what seems to be sheer insanity.</p>

<p>I have said often and through many channels that the world that you perceive is
diametrically opposed to the real world. It is exact opposite. Therefore, if
you would know the real world, the first step that is required is to retrain
the mind to be willing to <em>accept</em> that all things you believe you see are <em>only</em>
temporary reflections, or illusions. That the physical eyes have never shown
you the real world. That your ideas and perceptions based on the data that
comes through the senses of the body, these ideas have <em>always</em> been
diametrically opposed to the truth of the real world.</p>

<p>If there is, then, a call born within you, if there is that spark within
you–which means simply that the voice for God has finally crept in a little bit
and you’ve begun to hear–if there’s something in you that calls you to know the
<em>real world</em>, if there is something in you which calls you to know the peace of
God, if there is something in you that is even just a little willing to
surrender whatever needs to be surrendered to know that reality of God’s peace
and that perfect love which already you are, then you must make a decision. And
the decision is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I have used time and experienced time to gather evidence that what I
have taught myself to believe is true, then perhaps I need now to use
time to relinquish what I have believed to be true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The decision is the choice to be fully committed to allowing the
experiences of time, beginning right where you are in your daily life,
to be reinterpreted for you by a voice that is in you but is not quite
yours. At least not yet. The day <em>will come</em> when you will be one with
that voice. The day will come that you will know the truth that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I and my Father are one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The day will come when  though the physical eyes still seem to be
operating, you look lovingly upon the world that has been made in error,
this physical dimension, this constriction that you perceive within your
mind, for you will be looking at it through an <em>inner eye</em>, an aspect of
your beingness, your consciousness, that does have certain physical
correlates, yes, and you will activate that eye and you will open that
eye and you will look upon all things <em>through</em> that eye. And the sensory
data that comes into you will be as though filtered or transmuted so
that what you judge of what you see comes not from the beliefs and ideas
that you have mis–created, but those perceptions cleansed and purified
by the light and the wisdom that will shine through that inner eye.</p>

<p>Once when I sat with my friends that have heard are called disciples, I said
unto them: When the eye becomes single, then you will enter the kingdom. What
does such an odd statement mean? First it speaks on many levels to a truth that
can only be understood through the concept of levels. When the eyes becomes
single means that you have learned to relinquish your fixation of having the
attention of your mind linked <em>to your physical senses alone</em> and therefore to
all of the concepts and perceptions you have built <em>upon</em> sensory data coming in
through the body, and you have moved that attention to become centered and
settled in the <em>inner eye</em> so that the light of consciousness that shines upon
your experience reveals the reflection of the <em>real</em> world <em>through</em> all that you
see and experience.</p>

<p>The second level is this: You find yourself in conflict, you find yourself in
a world of duality. There is not a single thing. There’s always this and that,
up and down, light and dark, good and bad, right and wrong, best value – worst
value, best choice – worst choice. Everywhere you go throughout the day you are
confronted with the need to make a choice. This or that. Quite frankly it is
simply the choice between love and fear. But in your world that duality
prevails, and that is why the world in which you find yourself is <em>not</em> the real
world. For the real world is single and whole and <em>only</em> love abides there.</p>

<p>Now, to move then into the single life requires that you solve the dilemma of
living in duality. How do you do that? For everywhere you find yourself, there
you are in the physical world as long as the body lasts, and the body will last
as long as <em>you</em>, as a conscious being, continue to make the choice for it. By
retraining the mind to choose only love, by retraining the mind to surrender
every perception you’ve ever held about anything or anyone, in this way the day
will come when there will not be a <em>choice</em> for a physical body, but you will
find yourself much indeed with a body yet.</p>

<p>Now, how do you do that? How do you dry the skin while you’re swimming in the
stream? How do you still the noise while you are abiding in a deafening concert
of music? By learning to retrain the mind. There is no other way.</p>

<p>We spoke to you earlier that you do not know what a single thing is or what it
is for, and <em>that</em> is very good beginning to the process of retraining the mind.
The goal, then, is to reach a place of consciousness prior to every decision,
in which you <em>remember</em> the truth of who you are and that you are not yet living
in the real world, that what you are seeing before you as a choice that you
think you have to make is an illusion based on your past experience.</p>

<p>When you train your consciousness to abide in a clarity of singularity
that exists just prior to every choice that confronts you, then and
there you can learn to hear the voice of the holy one who will choose
for you, with your permission, until <em>your</em> consciousness has learned that
that one’s choices, the Holy Spirit’s, are always one hundred percent
accurate and serve the highest in you. You then assimilate or take on,
you allow yourself to reabide in the consciousness of the Holy Spirit
itself, and you <em>become that Voice</em>. It is no longer outside of you, no
longer hard to hear, for you have surrendered everything that kept your
identification linked to something other than that voice. Then, in
truth, there <em>are no more choices</em>, although you seem to abide yet within
the world, living from the singularity of the eye that sees clearly the
reflection of the real world through the illusory world that you have
laid over the top of it. From that place, although you live seemingly
yet within the body, you will know directly the <em>experience of living
without choice</em>. The dilemma of duality is solved, for there is no longer
fear within your mind. Nothing to hold onto, nothing to seek, nothing to
gain, and most importantly, nothing to lose. For the fear of loss is
what keeps you forever entrenched in the conflict of duality, and the
single eye remains unknown.</p>

<p>Retraining the mind, then, is the greatest use of time that you have before
you. None of the directions in which you think you are going will ever take you
to heaven if those directions have grown out of the way you’ve learned to make
choices. Let me give you an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am a body. I must survive. The world is out there and I know it can be
rather cruel. I better stay with the job I’ve got because survival is
the greatest value to me. Therefore I will choose (one believes freely)
to remain where the heart is not at peace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not a choice. Not a choice at all. It is an effect of fear and a lack
of right knowledge.</p>

<p>Freedom from all circumstance, freedom from conflict and fear, does not
come when the body seems to die. For if the end of conflict does not
come into your consciousness before the body dies, rest assured you will
find yourself simply and yet again in and as a body perceiving a world
in which conflict and duality reign.</p>

<p>There is no choice, then, but to awaken. And to awaken means that you
<em>relinquish</em> everything you thought you knew and allow an inner voice to
<em>retrain the use of your mind</em> until you recognize the real world and
abide in that peace that forever passes all understanding.</p>

<p>Many in the world will not recognize you when this has been completed, for you
see, no one can recognize a mind that has awakened unless at least some degree
of awakening has occurred within them as well. And that’s okay. For while the
body lasts you are free to teach only love. But not from the perception of
believing that you know what that means. Only love knows what it means and only
love knows what needs to be extended in each moment. Therefore, while you seem
to live yet in the world, from that singularity that is established through the
retraining of the mind and the relinquishing of fear, from that place you will
find that before each breath you are constantly and simply asking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is this moment for? What would you have done through it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you will come to hear the voice of the holy one so clearly and so
distinctly, that you will totally relinquish any doubt, any fear, any
anxiety. And from that moment you will indeed enter the kingdom, for the
eye will have been made single. You will go, then, as the wind, knowing
not where you came from or where you’re going. There will then only be
the eternal present in which you know beyond all shadow of doubt that
you are infinitely free and radiant forever and there is only the love
of God present wherever you happen to find yourself. Love will be
present when fear is gone.</p>

<p>Therefore, in retraining the mind, begin by recognizing that you do not know
what <em>this</em> moment is for, whatever this moment is, as it arises. Acknowledge
that there is one that you can trust–the Holy Spirit, the teacher and guide
given equally unto all until all have returned to the real world.</p>

<p>Learn to trust what you cannot see. Learn to hear what seems not to be
spoken out loud.  Learn to feel that which does not come <em>through</em> the
senses, but emerges from <em>within</em> them and enlightens them. Learn to look
truthfully upon the places where fear has made your home, and as you
look upon that place, look lovingly, for you have learned to fear
looking upon your fear. And why? Because you believe you <em>are</em> that fear
expressing as some pattern in your so–called personality.  Because you
are identified with it, your deepest fear is that if you allow light to
be shined upon it, it will dissolve and you with it. That is why I said
earlier the deepest fear is the fear of loss of a self that never was.</p>

<p>By retraining your mind through the humility of recognizing that you don’t know
what a single thing is for, that your only choice that you would make is to
know and remember and live in the peace of God, the mind will come to be
restructured, to be cleansed and purified and you will look out upon a world
transfigured and you will see shining through it the reflection of the real
world. You will know that you are fear–less, for there is no longer a self that
requires your constant protection against the great forces that seem to stand
against it. For there can be no great force standing against the true self,
that which shines radiantly with you, throughout you, and throughout all of
creation. And that self is the real world.</p>

<p>You are that one, shimmering brightly, far greater than ten thousand
suns. And when you look upon the vastness of your sky, realize that it
merely reflects a speck of the light in which it itself has emerged and
that light is you. All worlds, all dimensions, all planes of existence
arises from within <em>your</em> Holy Mind. You are the great vastness that
contains creation even now. And even now in reality you abide and live
and exist only in the real world. And the only distance between you in
the real world and the you that you think you are in the unreal world is
the width of a thought that you would insist on thinking.</p>

<p>Learn, then, to retrain the
mind to relinquish that thought whenever it appears. And you will know, though
it takes many forms, for you will always feel constricted, you will feel
separate from your brothers and sisters, you will feel that the love of this
earth of yours is distant from you and that the peace of God is nowhere to be
found. That is a sign that you have chosen to identify and to insist upon
a thought that can only birth unreality. Stop trying to defend it. Stop trying
to cherish it, because you think you made it and therefore you must keep it.
Simply let it go. A thousand times each day let it go. And choose a new
thought, a thought of simplicity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know not what a single thing is; Holy Spirit, teach me anew.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And allow time to become not that through which you seek
your own ends, but rather that through which you allow complete correction to
come to the holiness of your Perfect and Radiant Mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But, but, I have all of these problems. Jeshua, what am I supposed to
do with all of these problems?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Relinquish them. They are illusions. Everything that you think you see
as a problem to be solved is the <em>effect</em> of first having chosen an insane
thought.  Simply choose again, as often as you need, until peace
returns.</p>

<p>I promise you this: If you become <em>wholly committed</em> to awakening from the
dream you have dreamt since the stars first began to appear in the
heavens, and even before that, if your one desire is to be only what God
created, then lay at the altar of your heart with every breath,
everything you <em>think</em> you know, everything you <em>think</em> you need, and look
lovingly upon every place that fear has made a home in your mind, and
allow correction to come. It will come.  Regardless of how you
experience it, it <em>will</em> come.</p>

<p>And the day and the moment will arise and all of your pain and fear and
suffering will have vanished like a wind that pushes the foam of the
wave away, revealing the clarity of the ocean beneath you. You will
literally feel throughout your being that there never was a dream. Some
memories might remain with you and you will know that somewhere you
must’ve dreamt a dream or had a thought of wondering what it would be
like to be other than the way God created you, but it will be such a
faint echo that it will leave no trace upon you.  In your heart you will
smile gently regardless of the circumstances in which you find yourself.
There will be peace from the crown of the head to the tips of the toes,
so to speak, and that peace will walk before you wherever you go. It
will enter a room before you enter it with a body, and those who are
becoming sensitive will wonder who has come into their place. And some
will even say, “Behold, I believe Christ has come for dinner.” And you
will be that one, for that is who you are – Christ eternal.</p>

<p>Enter with me then now into that place of peace. Those of you that yet believe
you are but a body, then begin there. Begin by allowing the body to relax and
know that that’s not something you can <em>try</em> to do. You need only allow it. And
as the body relaxes, let your attention recede from the things that you believe
are around you. Give up your need to keep an eye on the world. Give up a need
to believe that there is something to accomplish and somewhere to go. Let it
sink into the depth of your own being. Not looking to see what’s there, but
surrendering. Let the breath flow through the body as though something else
were breathing it for you. Relax even the activity of the brain, as though it
were just another muscle that you could allow to relax. And as you rest and
surrender into that inexplicable place of being, the mystery of <em>your</em> existence
far beyond what the body could ever touch and know, far beyond what the human
emotions are capable of containing, far beyond every thought and every belief
and every experience you’ve ever known, there rests the shimmering brilliance
of the light of your self. Abide in that. Surrender into that. Know only that.</p>

<p>And there, in that place, the great depth of your own mind and being, this day,
make a new choice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Father, I know not what I have done, I know not how I have dreamed the dream of
separation from you, but I relinquish it. I acknowledge that I do not know what
a single thing is or what it’s for, I know not the moment of my own creation,
and therefore I surrender into the radiance and purity of your peace and your
love. I open my self to receive only you. This alone I am asked to do of you,
and this alone I choose. Grant me that wisdom and that strength and that
passion by which I might learn to use time constructively as a sacrament of
surrender of all that has been unlike love within me. You are the way, the
truth, and the light. And I return to the sacred place of our union. I remain
as you have created me to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, remember then that you will awaken to your own call. You are doing
so even now. What you experience along the way is completely and freely
chosen. Not one bit of it has been necessary, yet not one trace of it
extinguishes or limits the radiance of who you are. It’s all in the
simplicity of a moment’s choice.  Let time, then, become your precious
friend until time is needed no longer and is given over to the Holy
Spirit. You might then yet find yourself in time again and yet again,
but you will not experience it as the world has taught you to. You will
see it only as a temporary dance in which you are enjoined freely as a
way through which the love of God can gently descend and touch the
unreal world, lighting it again with reality and bringing the unreal to
the real, bringing heaven to earth.</p>

<p>You are that one in whom our Father remains eternally
well pleased. You are that one unto what has been given unto you, all power
under heaven and earth, right now in the palm of your hand. For the power of
heaven and earth, which is a duality, is the power of <em>choice</em>, the power of
<em>consciousness</em>, the <em>power</em> to be committed to own all that you see as
self–created, the <em>power</em> to relinquish it to that one voice within you that
knows alone how to transmute and translate every thought you have ever held to
that which reflects perfectly the radiance of the love that joins you with your
creator. In truth, the way <em>is</em> easy and without effort if only the choice is
made.</p>

<p>Herein we come to the close of this moment’s message, again as a stepping stone
linked to what has been shared previously. Use it well, use it wisely, and
contemplate it often, for it will remind you of the path upon which you walk.
For in truth, if you hear these words now, you <em>have already chosen</em> to reclaim
the real world within you.</p>

<p>So, we will give pause for a few moments here. And then if you would be willing
to give me some of your time, we will entertain and be entertained by certain
questions that have emerged within the minds of your brothers and sisters. And
many of you will know that these are likewise your questions.</p>

<p>Be then at peace, beloved friends, and know that I am simply here in the real
world, waiting for you to recognize that that too is where you are and that you
no longer entertain a desire to be anywhere else.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
