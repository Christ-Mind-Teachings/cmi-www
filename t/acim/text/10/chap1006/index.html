    <p>It is impossible not to believe what you see, but it is equally
impossible to see what you do NOT believe. Perceptions are built up on
the basis of experience, and experience leads to beliefs. It is not
until beliefs are fixed that perceptions stabilize. In effect, then,
what you believe you DO see. That is what I meant when I said, “Blessed
are ye who have not seen and still believe,” for those who believe in
the resurrection WILL see it. The resurrection is the complete triumph
of Christ over the ego, not by attack, but by transcendence. For Christ
DOES rise above the ego and all its works, and ascends to the Father and
HIS Kingdom.</p>

<p>Would you join in the resurrection or the crucifixion? Would you condemn
your brothers or free them? Would you transcend YOUR prison and ascend
to the Father? For these questions are all the same, and are answered
together. There has been much confusion about what perception means,
because the same word is used both for awareness and for the
INTERPRETATION of awareness. Yet you cannot BE aware without
interpretation, and what you perceive IS your interpretation. This
course is perfectly clear. You do not see it clearly because you are
interpreting AGAINST it, and therefore do not BELIEVE it. And if belief
determines perception, you do NOT perceive what it means and therefore
do not ACCEPT it.</p>

<p>Yet different experiences lead to different beliefs, and experience
teaches. I am leading you to a new kind of experience which you will
become less and less willing to deny. Learning of Christ is easy, for to
perceive with Him involves no strain at all. HIS perceptions are your
NATURAL awareness, and it is only distortions which YOU introduce that
tire you. Let the Christ in you interpret FOR you, and do not try to
limit what you see by narrow little beliefs which are unworthy of God’s
Son. For until Christ comes into His Own, the Son of God WILL see
himself as fatherless.</p>

<p>I am YOUR resurrection and YOUR life. You live in me because you live in
God. And everyone lives in YOU, as YOU live in everyone. Can you, then,
perceive unworthiness in a brother and NOT perceive it in yourself? And
can you perceive it in yourself and NOT perceive it in God? Believe in
the resurrection because it has BEEN accomplished, and it has been
accomplished IN YOU. This is
as true now as it will ever be, for the resurrection is the Will of God,
Which knows no time and no exceptions. But make no exceptions yourself,
or you will not perceive what has been accomplished FOR you. For we
ascend unto the Father together, as it was in the beginning, is now, and
ever shall be, for such is the nature of God’s Son as His Father created
him.</p>

<p>Do not underestimate the power of the devotion of God’s Son, nor the
power of the god he worships over him. For he places HIMSELF at the
altar of his god, whether it be the god he made or the God Who created
him. That is why his slavery is as complete as his freedom, for he will
obey ONLY the god he accepts. The god of the crucifixion demands that he
crucify, and his worshippers obey. In his name they crucify THEMSELVES,
believing that the power of the Son of God is born of sacrifice and
pain. The God of the resurrection demands NOTHING, for He does not will
to take away. He does not require obedience, for obedience implies
submission. He would only have you learn your OWN will and follow it,
not in the spirit of sacrifice and submission, but in the gladness of
freedom.</p>

<p>Resurrection must compel your allegiance gladly because it is the symbol
of joy. Its whole compelling power lies in the fact that it represents
what YOU want to be. The freedom to leave behind everything that hurts
you and humbles you and frightens you cannot be thrust upon you, but it
CAN be offered you through the grace of God. And you can ACCEPT it by
His grace, for God IS gracious to His Son, accepting him without
question as His Own. Who, then, is YOUR own? The Father has given you
all that is His, and He Himself is yours WITH them. Guard them in their
resurrection, for otherwise you will not awake in God, safely surrounded
by what is yours forever.</p>

<p>You will not find peace until you have removed the nails from the hands
of God’s Son and taken the last thorn from his forehead. The Love of God
surrounds His Son whom the god of the crucifixion condemns. Teach not
that I died in vain. Teach rather that I did NOT die by demonstrating
that I live IN YOU. For the UNDOING of the crucifixion of God’s Son is
the work of the redemption, in which everyone has a part of equal value.
God does not judge His blameless Son. Having given HIMSELF to him, how
could it be otherwise?</p>

<p>You have nailed YOURSELF to a cross and placed a crown of thorns upon
your OWN head. Yet you CANNOT crucify God’s Son, for the Will of God
cannot die. His Son HAS BEEN redeemed from his own crucifixion, and you
cannot assign to death whom God has given eternal life. The dream of
crucifixion still lies heavy on your eyes, but what you see in dreams is
not reality. While you perceive the Son of God as crucified you are
asleep. And as long as you believe that YOU can crucify him you are only
having nightmares. You who are beginning to wake are still aware of
dreams and have not yet forgotten them. The forgetting of dreams and the
awareness of Christ comes with the awakening of others to SHARE your
redemption.</p>

<p>You will awaken to your OWN call, for the Call to awake is WITHIN you.
If I live in you, you ARE awake. Yet you must see the works I do through
you, or you will not perceive that I have done them UNTO you. Do not set
limits on what you believe I can do through you, or you will not accept
what I can do FOR you. For it is done ALREADY, and unless you give all
that you have received, you will not know that your Redeemer liveth and
that YOU have awakened WITH Him. Redemption is recognized ONLY by
sharing it.</p>

<p>God’s Son IS saved. Bring only THIS awareness to the Sonship, and you
will have a part in the redemption as valuable as mine. For your part
must be LIKE mine if you learn it of me. If you believe that YOURS is
limited, YOU are limiting MINE. There is no order of difficulty in
miracles because all of God’s Sons are of equal value, and their
equality is their Oneness. The whole power of God is in every part of
Him, and nothing contradictory to His Will is either great or small. What
does not exist has NO size and NO measure. To God ALL things are
possible. And to Christ it is given to be LIKE the Father.</p>
