    <p>4.1 Creation is not an aspect of this world alone. Creation is an aspect
of the whole, the all of all, the alpha and the omega, eternity and
infinity. It is not only life as you know it now, but life in all its
aspects. It is life beyond death as well as life before birth and life
during your time here. It is all one because it is all from the same
Source.</p>

<p>4.2 You are not only part of creation, but as has been said many times,
a creator, and as such a continuing act of creation. This does not mean
that creation is acted out upon you but that you are acted out upon
creation. The idea of creation as something static would be completely
contrary to the meaning of creation. Yet you continue to think that you
stand apart from it and affect it not. This is consistent to the
thinking that would tell you that you are at the mercy of fate. Fate and
creation are hardly the same thing. You are at the mercy only of your
own ego and only until you willingly let it go.</p>

<p>4.3 A Course in Miracles and A Course of Love work hand-in-hand because
the change of thinking taught within A Course in Miracles was a change
of thinking about yourself. It attempted to dislodge the ego-mind that
has provided you with an identity that you but think you are. A Course
of Love then followed in order to reveal to you who you truly are. While
you continue to act within the world as who you think you are rather
than as who you are, you have not integrated these two pieces of
learning.</p>

<p>4.4 This is the stage of learning that you are at and what this Treatise
addresses. This Treatise is attempting to show you how to live as who
you are, how to act within the world as the new Self you have
identified. Just like learning how to swim, it is a new way of movement.
Just as moving through water is a way of movement quite inconsistent
with that of moving on land, so too is the new way of acting out or
expressing who you are quite inconsistent with the way in which you have
formerly acted out or expressed who you are. This is, of course, because
you formerly acted out of a set of conditions that corresponded to who
you think you are rather than who you truly are.</p>

<p>4.5 You will almost literally continue to “bump in” to who you think you
are as you complete the process of unlearning. It might be best
explained by continuing with the swimming metaphor. If acting in the
world as who you truly are is like swimming, bumping in to who you think
you are could be likened to trying to move within water as you would on
land. Why, when moving freely through the water would you suddenly try
to move as if on land? The explanation could be as simple as forgetting
where you are, or as complex as a sudden panic or fear brought on by any
number of factors.  Either way, the result would always be the same; a
sudden change from ease of movement to struggle, from going with the
flow to resistance.</p>

<p>4.6 A first step then in learning to recognize when you are acting upon
notions of who you think you are rather than on who you truly are, is
the appearance of struggle or resistance. As a swimmer quickly learns,
the only way to return to ease of movement is to cease to struggle or
resist.  The ability to let go of struggle is a learned ability for the
swimmer and is a learned ability for you now as you journey back to your
real Self. It requires remembrance, trust, and a wholehearted approach
that allows the body, mind and heart to act in unison. This wholehearted
approach is the condition from which unity is recognized. The water is
not taken for granted but always recognized as the condition of the
swimmer’s environment. You are no longer confined to the conditions of
separation, my dear brothers and sisters, and this is what it is time
for you to learn.</p>

<p>4.7 This applies directly to your reaction to all that occurs within
your life. Let us look now at your reaction to the idea put forth
earlier of having a calling.</p>

<p>4.8 Despite whatever way you currently have of identifying calling as it
relates to you there are few among you who have not reacted to the idea
of calling with two sets of feelings and thoughts. One set of thoughts
and feelings contain all that one might attribute to the glad acceptance
of a gift of high value, or in other words, a treasure. One set of
thoughts and feelings contain all that one might attribute to the
somewhat onerous onset of yet another responsibility, another
obligation. One set of thoughts recognizes that something has been
given. The other set recognizes that something has been asked. The
wholehearted response is one that recognizes that giving and receiving
are the same in truth.</p>

<p>4.9 While two sets of thoughts and feelings exist, the only way to come
to peace with them is through an acceptance of ambiguity. While an
acceptance of ambiguity might seem preferable to conflict, an acceptance
of ambiguity is a rejection of your power. What is required to claim
your power is the willingness to move through the conflict of two
opposing sets of thoughts and feelings to the place of unity.</p>

<p>4.10 Thus a first step in our work with regard to calling is recognizing
the dualistic nature of your thoughts and feelings. A second step is
willingness to move past both ambiguity and conflict to union.</p>

<p>4.11 This requires an examination of your specific notions concerning
calling as you apply them to yourself. Whether you feel that you a have
a specific calling, no calling, or many callings, matters not at this
juncture.  What matters is that you think it does. You think it matters
because you compare and judge rather than accept.</p>

<p>4.12 You who have so recently felt the peace of true acceptance are not
asked to leave that peace to go in search of calling but are rather
asked to listen from within that peace to what you feel called to do.
This is not about the past and all those things that at one time or
another you thought would bring you fulfillment. This is about
recognizing who you are now. This is not a quick fix that calls you to
what might have been and tells you that if you had but acted earlier you
would have had the life you’ve dreamed of and maybe it is not too late.
This is not about examining where the various calls you responded to
previously have led you. All these notions are concerned with who you
have thought yourself to be, not with who you are. They do not recognize
the difference between thinking and knowing.</p>

<p>4.13 Being who you are is what you are called to do. You are here asked
to live a life as seamless as that of the birds of the air. You are
asked to live a life where there is no division between who you are and
what you do. This place of no division is the place of unity.</p>

<p>4.14 Now you may feel as if this Treatise has led around in a circle,
bringing you back only to contemplate again the acceptance of where you
are now.  However, to accept where you are is not the same as accepting
who you are.  Accepting where you are, as if it is a static place at
which you have arrived, is not the goal that has been set. Accepting who
you are includes acceptance of creation. The acceptance of creation is
the acceptance of change and growth but neither of these are concepts
that you understand truly. Change is not negative and growth does not
imply lack.</p>

<p>4.15 You must be beginning to see that your thought processes, the very
thought processes that tell you hour-by-hour and minute-by-minute how to
perceive of and live in your world, are still often based on old
concepts.  This does not mean you have not changed nor that you are in
need of accomplishment rather than the already accomplished. What this
means is that you are still in need of unlearning, of undoing old
patterns of thought. This is atonement and it is continuous and ongoing
until it is no longer needed.  Anything continuous and ongoing is part
of creation. Thus the very act of undoing old patterns is an act of
creation. As the old is undone, a vacuum is not created. The new is
created.</p>

<p>4.16 You are in the process of unmaking what you have made. The old
structure is coming down so that the new, what might be likened to a
building with no frame, can rise.</p>

<p>4.17 This process too is union for it is giving and receiving as one
although you recognize it not as such. It is not a process of waiting
until one thing is accomplished for another to begin. What is happening
now is happening in unison. As the old goes, the new arrives. There is
no time-lapse in this learning and so it is a condition of miracle
readiness. The old is replaced by the new simultaneously.</p>

<p>4.18 This is why you do not have to “wait” to hear your calling even
though some of you may feel as if you are in a time of waiting for you
hear no such call. The call is to be who you are and this is happening
at lightning speed, a speed that cannot be measured because of its
simultaneous nature. As was said within A Course of Love, time is but a
measurement of the “time” it takes for learning to occur. As this notion
of time dissolves, the state of miracle-readiness becomes your natural
state.</p>

<p>4.19 While this adjustment of your thinking may not seem to be the
miracle that it truly is, as your awareness of it grows, it is going to
raise it to a level you will come to think of as an ability. As your old
way of responding to life causes you to struggle or resist and the new
way of thinking replaces that old pattern with a new pattern of
response, you will begin to see that each new response is the answer to
a call that your heart alone can hear. As I have said, your heart has
now become your eyes and ears. Your heart hears only one call, one
voice, the language of one Source—that of unity.</p>
