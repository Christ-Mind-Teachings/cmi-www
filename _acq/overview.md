## Overview of Teachings
{: .disable-paragraph-marker}

The diagram illustrates how the library is organized. There are four different teachings represented by vertical columns containing a box for each component. Notice the columns headed with "acim", "raj", "wom", "acol", and "jsb". Columns containing <i class="search icon"></i> icon indicate teachings that are fully indexed and searchable. See the [CMI Search](/acq/search/) section for information about search.

Boxes headed by a <i class="volume up icon"></i> symbol indicate teachings with integrated audio. See the [CMI Audio](/acq/audio/) section of *Get Acquainted* for information about the audio player and other features.

</div>

The number in parenthesis, for example (29), indicate the number of chapters or lessons or questions that that teaching component contains.

The first box under each teaching is labeled *Get Acquainted* and contains one or more pages of pertainate information about the teaching. Please note help and information about the Library itself is found in the *Get Acquainted* box with the red border in the diagram.
