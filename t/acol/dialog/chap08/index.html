    <p>8.1 Continuing to imagine your body as the dot within the circle, I ask
you to imagine now being able to take a step outside of the area of this
dot, and into the area of the wider circle. In this area of the wider
circle, there is no time, no space, no particularity. It is an area of
unlimited freedom. Yet we will begin with parameters that make this area
as imaginable to you as possible, because here is where all that you can
imagine can become your new reality.</p>

<p>8.2 Imagine this first as a place where no learning is needed. Ah, you
might say now, this you have heard before. This idea of no longer
needing to learn has intrigued you since it was first mentioned, and yet
it seems too impossible, too “good” to be true. You are too used to
thinking of yourself as a learning being to truly experience the freedom
of not being bound by this constraint. In all of your life, you can
think of no ability you have not achieved through learning. And yet most
of you have “discovered” something that comes easily to you, something
you might have said or been told you have a natural talent or ability to
do. These things some of you have practiced or studied to take advantage
of your natural ability and in doing so may have found a continued
ability to learn faster or achieve more in this area than those who are
not seen as having a “natural ability” of this particular kind. But
because you are prone to comparison, many of you have been discouraged
by not being able to be the “best” despite your natural talent or
ability, and have given up “working hard” to be the best. Others who
have achieved the highest possible acclaim for their talents find this
acclaim unfulfilling once it is achieved.</p>

<p>8.3 All of these ideas we leave behind as we concentrate instead on the
very simple idea of each of you containing a natural ability or talent
that existed in some form prior to the time of learning. We concentrate
on this idea merely as an idea and not in terms of the specific ability
it may represent. We concentrate on this idea as the first parameter of
the territory of your conscious awareness as you let awareness grow in
you that you have experienced something that existed prior to the time
of learning. And that this something was quite wonderful.</p>

<p>8.4 You might think of this ability that existed prior to the time of
learning as coming from the content of the wider circle of who you are
to infiltrate the dot of the body, or, conversely, as the body having
taken a step outside of the dot of self to infiltrate the wider circle
of the Self. When you have realized that you are “more” than your body,
your natural talent or ability has been one of the primary factors
leading to this realization. It has been one of the primary factors
leading to this realization because a part of you has always known this
ability was a “given.” That you are gifted—given to—and able to receive.
And despite what science might have to say to you about the source of
such talents or abilities, you have known that they are not of the body.</p>

<p>8.5 To accept this is to accept that you have access to a “given” Self,
to something neither earned nor worked hard to attain. To imagine this
as an idea is to imagine this “given” Self as the Self that exists
beyond the boundary we have described as the dot of the body.</p>

<p>8.6 This idea will aid you too in your understanding of discovery, as
your natural abilities or talents were discovered and in that discovery,
you realized that although you had not previously known that this talent
or ability existed, it was there awaiting but your discovery. You may
also have seen that in the expression of this talent or ability new
discoveries awaited you and that you greeted these discoveries with
surprise and delight. As was written in A Treatise on the New, these
surprises of discovery have, and will, cause you to laugh and be joyous.
There was never any need, and will never be any need, to figure them
out—for surprises cannot be figured out! Surprises are meant to be
joyous gifts being constantly revealed. Gifts that need only be received
and responded to. Not learned.</p>

<p>8.7 While discovery of the new will naturally include much that goes
beyond what you now think of as your natural talents or abilities, the
place or Source of your natural talents or abilities is a place from
which to start building your awareness of what is available or given—of
what is but awaiting your discovery and conscious awareness. Thus, like
the home in which you reside, the idea that you have an already existing
awareness of the Source of unity beyond the body will increase your
comfort level, and will help establish it as the first parameter in the
territory of your conscious awareness.</p>

<p>8.8 Now this is not new information. Much of this was taught in A
Treatise on the Nature of Unity and Its Recognition. Between the Course
and the Treatises, all of what you needed to learn was put forth. What
we are now doing is discussing what was taught from the realm of
wholeheartedness. What was learned was only able to be learned because
you chose to become the wholehearted. You chose to join mind and heart
and it was done. But you do not yet know how to rid yourself of former
patterns. Your mind, while it no longer wants to cling to known
patterns, is confronted with them constantly. Thus your heart still
seems to battle with the supremacy of mind.</p>

<p>8.9 So what we are attempting to do is to open the mind to the wisdom of
the heart with these dialogues. As the mind opens and accepts the new,
the art of thought will become your new means of thinking. What has been
learned will become an ability to think wholeheartedly, or with mind and
heart in union, and then that ability will transcend ability and
wholehearted will become what you are, and wholeheartedness your sole
means of expression.</p>

<p>8.10 The self and the expression of self that comes from any place other
than wholeheartedness is not the true Self or the true expression of the
Self but the self-expression that arises from separation.
Self-expression that arises from separation is still valuable, as it is
a sign of yearning toward the true Self and the true expression of the
Self. Thus where you have desired to express yourself in the past is
very likely linked to the natural ability or talent you did not have to
learn, to that which was given and available just a step beyond where
the separated self could reach.</p>

<p>8.11 Expand your reach! Step outside of the dot of the separated self
and into the circle of unity where all you desire is already
accomplished in the fullness and wholeness of the undivided Self.</p>

<p>8.12 The divided self is the small self of separation that is constantly
yearning for union with that from which it is divided. Enter the place
of no division, the place of shared consciousness, the place of
wholeness. The natural ability that you recognize as a given and
unlearned aspect of your Self is the doorway. Step through that doorway.
Take the first step outside of the known reality of your conscious
awareness, the learned reality of your separate consciousness, and into
the realm of shared consciousness.</p>

<p>8.13 Do not be surprised, however, if no shaft of light descends upon
you, if you feel as if you have taken that step and yet remain
unchanged. When you choose to take this step it is taken. What you will
become aware of on the other side of that door will require a new way of
seeing, a new kind of awareness.</p>
