## Getting Around
{: .disable-paragraph-marker}

There are two different page layouts used in the Library, one is used as landing pages that lists the contents of a teaching or the teachings in the Library. The other is the document layout that contains the content of the teaching. The layouts are similar but differ as described below.

### Landing Pages

<div class="ui container" markdown="1">
  ![Landing Page](/public/img/cmi/landing-nav.jpg)
</div>

#### Heading

The heading is found on every page including document pages. It's a link and will always return back to the Library card catalog. Clicking the header is a way to move around the library quickly.

#### Teaching

The teaching is found on every page and identifies the source of the content. It is not a link because the page is the homepage of the teaching.

#### Menu

The menu offers access to the functions available on the page. The options available may vary slightly between landing pages.

<div class="ui relaxed list">
  <div class="item">
    <i class="bookmark icon"></i>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="header">Bookmark and Annotation</div>
      <div class="description">
        Displays a list of bookmarks and associated annotations defined for all components of the teachings. See <a href="/acq/bookmark/">Bookmarks and Annotations</a> in the <em>Get Acquainted</em> section for details.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="item">
    <i class="search icon"></i>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="header">CMI Search</div>
      <div class="description">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="item">
    <i class="question icon"></i>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="header">Help</div>
      <div class="description">
        This item offers several help options. <em>Tour This Page</em> and <em>Getting Around</em> provide a quick interactive tour of features on the page. The other options link to this documentation.
      </div>

  </div>
  <div class="item">
    <i class="sign in icon"></i>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="header">Sign In/Sign Out</div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
        You can create an account and sign in. This is most useful when working with bookmarks causing bookmarks to be stored in the cloud. In this way bookmarks are sync'd between devices. Bookmarks created when you are not sign in are available only on the device in which they were created.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is for this reason that the bookmark menu option and the sign in/sign out icon shows red when you are not signed in.
        </p>
