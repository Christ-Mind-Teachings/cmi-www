    <p>Now, we begin.</p>

<p>And indeed, once again, greetings unto you, beloved and holy friends. We
come forth to abide with you now as we initiate the third and final year
of this <em>formal information</em> that we have sought to share with you. This
information will, in time to come, be shared with millions. We have
chosen to entitle this year’s lessons <em>The Way of Knowing</em>.</p>

<p>What, then, requires <em>True Knowledge</em>? What, then, is required for True
Knowledge to exist? How does one live — in whatever dimension of
Creation — when they abide in True Knowing? Beloved friends, that which
is required for <em>True Knowledge</em> to pervade the whole of one’s
consciousness is simply this: <em>Not for one moment</em> have you <em>ever</em> lived
life. Rather, in Truth, and in Reality, Life, which is but Love
streaming forth from the Source of all Creation, has <em>sought</em> to live <em>as
you</em>. Never at any time has there, in Truth, been a false self. Never has
there been a time in which something called the ego has existed.</p>

<p>You have heard us say unto you many times that what is true about you is
true always, and that you remain as you are created to be — the Thought
of Perfect Love in form. You emanate from the Mind of the Creator as a
wave emanates from the ocean. The great secret of your human existence,
indeed, the great secret of the many journeys you have taken, is that
they have existed <em>nowhere</em> save <em>within</em> the movie screen of your own mind.</p>

<p>Does this mean that your dreams have had no effect? Within the dream
itself, as long as you choose to be identified with it, you <em>will</em>
experience the effects of the choices which you have made. And yet, now,
as the heart has touched purification and as you have truly been willing
to allow transformation to occur, all that matters and must be
remembered is that <em>you</em>, as you <em>thought</em> yourself to be, has never truly
existed. It has been a smoke screen. It has been a chimera. It has been
illusion.</p>

<p>Knowledge, then, consists of the crystal-clear awareness that while
Creation streams forth from the Mind of God, you cannot find the place
that a separate self began. And you have absolutely no knowledge of
where your end will be found. In Truth, <em>you</em> do not know what is going to
unfold in the very next moment of your experience. This can only mean,
since you <em>do</em> have a next moment, that <em>something else is living you</em>.</p>

<!-- Track t2 -->

<p>In the beginning of the journey, there must be <em>desire</em>, for no one can
come unto the Father without it. For just as you use the energy of
desire to dream the dream of separation that closed your heart, that set
you on a thousand useless journeys, propelled and compelled by fear, by
judgment, by doubt — likewise, desire has been necessary for you to be
willing to face your illusions, to look more deeply at your judgments,
and to see that they can have no value save that which you extend unto
them. It has, indeed, required desire for you to <em>want</em> to awaken.</p>

<p>As you have used the power of <em>intention</em> to continually etch into the
mind the beliefs and perceptions that are the very foundation of the
dream of separation, so, too, have you learned to use intention through
time, which is your creation, in order to awaken from time and from
fear.</p>

<p>Just as you once used the power of <em>allowing</em> to give permission to the
creations held within your mind to seemingly — apparently — take form in
front of your eyes, and allowed their “reality” to become so deeply
entrenched that, literally, worlds have been birthed from it, so, too,
have you needed to use allowance in the process of transformation,
<em>allowing</em> yourself to feel what you did not want to feel before, to see
differently what you had once insisted could only be seen in a certain
way. Allowing has been the very field from which all forgiveness you
have learned has sprung forth. Allowing has been the most central of
keys in the process of your healing and awakening. For when you truly
begin to touch upon the power of <em>genuine allowing</em>, you begin to taste
the first levels of <em>true freedom</em>. You have learned that just as you have
allowed new beginnings to occur, you have also discovered that you have
the power to allow endings to occur within the field of phenomena you
call “the world.”</p>

<p>And yet, I say unto you, <em>surrender</em> is the completion of the Keys to the
Kingdom. Just as once you had need of surrendering to your illusions in
order to identify the fundamental energy of your being <em>with</em> your
illusions, just as you have had to live in surrender to even allow
allowance, just as you have learned to rest in surrender even to allow
intention, just as you have learned to rest in surrender even to allow
desire to be made new within you, as you enter <em>The Way of Knowing</em>, the
<em>final surrender</em> is entered — that surrender which is beyond the
comprehension of all the languages and theologies of your world, beyond
all that can be spoken or uttered, yet not what can be <em>known, felt,
realized, and lived</em>!</p>

<p>For in surrender you look upon a perfectly harmless world, whether it
seems to be outside of the body or within the body-mind, itself. You
look upon the comings and goings of the world and you find that all
things are, of themselves, perfectly empty. You look within and discover
that no longer need you <em>obstruct</em>, from the conscious mind, from your
awareness, what the body-mind has experienced from the moment of its
conception. No longer is there an <em>obstruction</em> to the <em>flow of experience</em>.
No longer is there a self seeking God. And where and when that self has
been surrendered, the mind awakens to the simple Reality that there is
<em>only</em> God. And <em>you are</em> That One.</p>

<!-- Track t3 -->

<p>Yes — as you seek to find words to communicate to yourself, or perhaps
to another, the great wonder, the great mystery, the great Truth, the
great simplicity of awakening into True Knowing — you will strive to
find a way to communicate, as I have tried to find ways to communicate
with you. You will seek to communicate to your brothers and sisters that
there is only God, and yet … and yet … there is the power of the
mind to perceive yourself as the Created — which in Truth, you are. For
<em>God gives rise to God, looking back upon Himself</em>. Mystery of pure
content gives rise to temporary form in order that Pure Mystery might be
apprehended.</p>

<p>You are, then, the very process whereby That One who alone is without a
second creates the temporary form through which That One apprehends and
knows Itself. You are That One that is the perfect <em>effect</em> of Mystery,
that would pour forth of Itself and make visible what was invisible; to
birth through time and form that which cannot be contained within it.
For Love is unfathomable. You cannot control it. Love is vast beyond all
measure. You cannot contain it. Love cannot be possessed. It can only be
allowed.</p>

<p>Therefore, indeed, beloved friends, the very Keys whereby once you used
the power of your own mind to create the illusion of a separate self,
are the very Keys utilized by your own mind to awaken you to the Truth
that you have never been, that there is only and always <em>this</em> mysterious
moment. And all things have been birthed from Perfect Mystery.</p>

<p>The Awakened Mind — awakened from false arrogance — looks upon all
things and says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am That One.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet, no trace of separation or duality exists, for you are not apart
from all things that are arising: the wind that blows through the trees,
the wisps of a cold winter rain, the warmth of the sun upon the skin of
the body, the embrace of a lover, the laughter of a child. The Awakened
Mind that abides in Perfect Knowing no longer <em>obstructs</em> perception,
feeling, the flow of thought, the flow of experience. It no longer looks
to see how it can make things <em>different</em> than they are. It looks only,
and lives from, what it most truly wants: simply to abide in its own
nature and to allow Life to flow from that nature, dancing in the
infinite myriad displays of form.</p>

<!-- Track t4 -->

<p>What, then, is required for True Knowledge to exist? What is indeed
required to abide in <em>The Way of Knowing</em>? To <em>fully accept</em> that <em>not one
trace of your seeking</em> has ever brought you closer to Reality; that <em>not
one modality</em> has ever held the <em>power</em> to bring you closer to God; that
<em>never</em> could it have ever been truly possible for you to make progress
toward the Consciousness of God. For all the while, you have been the
One you are seeking, <em>pretending</em> to be a seeker. And for what reason, for
what reason have you entertained the thought of separation?</p>

<p>The reason is simply this: <em>to do it</em>. For the Mind of God does not deny
<em>any</em> possibility, for It sees nothing that can obstruct the purity of Its
own nature. And forever the Father abides within Himself — infinite,
vast, radiant, silent — the Infinite Field of Pure Knowledge, Pure
Intelligence, out of which <em>all</em> things, and <em>all</em> possibilities arise. This
is why I once said unto you,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have never looked upon another, for you see only your Self.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are free to judge yourself by judging your brother and, thereby,
create a form of experience. But even that form of experience is <em>only</em>
the Perfect Reality of God. And That is what you are!</p>

<p>What, then, requires True Knowledge? God does. And from the very moment
that you first had the thought,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want God,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>even that thought has appeared within the field of what you believe is
your limited awareness as a limited body-mind, racked by fear and doubt
and guilt and all of the rest — all of it is illusion. That thought of
wanting God, the moment in which your journey home began, <em>that thought</em>
is the presence of God awakening Itself to that which has never been
lost.</p>

<p><em>God is what requires True Knowledge.</em> The thirst that you have felt for
God is God’s thirst for Herself. You are literally the Field of
Awareness of God in which God has awareness of Himself, because you are
the Power of God, and <em>only</em> by that Power have you ever been able to be
aware of <em>something</em> that has appeared to be <em>other</em> than God, for <em>even fear
rests in Love</em>.</p>

<p>Even fear, contraction, and the dream of separation <em>require Love</em>, for
Love <em>allows</em> all things, <em>trusts</em> all things, <em>embraces</em> all things, and
therefore <em>transcends</em> all things. And in your own, what you might still
wish to perceive to be your “own experience,” as though it were separate
and apart from your brothers and sisters, as though it were separate and
apart from the twinkling of the stars, and the dance of the sunlight
upon the water, and the thought in the brilliant mind of a scientist,
and the cry of a newborn child — even if you wish, yet, to maintain that
you have something called “private experience,” that private experience
has required the presence of God. Every thought you have ever held has
existed only because <em>Love has allowed it</em>!</p>

<p>Have you suffered, then, because God has chosen it? Not at all. For in
Truth — and please listen carefully — <em>suffering does not exist</em>. Only the
Reality of Love can exist. And you are That One with the <em>power</em> to be
awakened to your true nature — right now, right here! Indeed, only when
you have given up attachment to the modalities, the meditations, the
prayers, the theologies, the textbooks, only when <em>you</em> have given up
attachment to all form and merely make the decision to abide in the
Simple Knowledge that you are That One, <em>only then</em> does Knowledge
permeate your awareness.</p>

<p>If there was something you had to <em>do</em> to <em>get</em> to God, then God is apart
from where you are. Yet it is the very Love of Pure Consciousness that
gives you the power to perceive that there is something you must do to
get to God — and therefore, God is always present. If there was truly
some form of meditation that could enlighten you, it would mean that <em>you</em>
were <em>truly</em> apart from God at some point. But it is not possible for That
One to be separate from Itself. Allow, then, the mind to rest in the
simplicity that what is true has been true always, and that where you
abide you are merely the manifestation of That One showing up as a man
or a woman.</p>

<!-- Track t5 -->

<p>In True Knowledge, in <em>genuine True Knowledge</em>, which exists NOW HERE, and
cannot be gotten tomorrow, there is only the pure simplicity of the
moment which is arising, looked upon with perfect innocence. In True
Knowledge there is perfect peace. In True Knowledge one merely abides
awake, witnessing the play and display of phenomena which are, indeed,
arising only within that one Mind that the Sonship is.</p>

<p>I have said often to you that you cannot truly make a wrong turn, and no
one has ever made a wrong turn in their journey. How could this be
possible in the Field of Pure Love that is God? And only Love is Real.
You have merely allowed yourself — as God — to formulate shapes of
experience merely to experience it. Every tear that you have cried,
every loss that you have felt is yet only <em>God</em> choosing to have the
experience. And you have remained eternally free in each moment to
choose again. And indeed, you <em>will</em> choose again without end. For there
is not a “time” that God will cease to be. For if God <em>could</em> cease to be,
then God is not God, for there would need to be a field of energy in
which <em>non-being</em> could exist.</p>

<p>The Mind that is Awakened serves only the Holy Spirit, and the Holy
Spirit is merely Right-mindedness. And what is Right-mindedness if not
True Knowledge?</p>

<p><em>The Way of Knowing</em>, then, is a way of unobstructed feeling, unobstructed
allowance, not only of what is around you, but what is <em>arising</em> from
within you. The work that I do through this, my beloved brother, is not
done because someone else is requiring me to do it. It arises within the
Field of the Mind of God that <em>is</em> the essence of all that I am as Christ.
It arises, is witnessed and allowed by me. And therefore, the work is
done. This is no different than what you experience in your
moment-to-moment experience. When you watch a raindrop fall and touch
the window through which you look, you have utilized, and indeed are,
the presence of the Power of Awareness that is no different than that
which pervades me and through which this communication work is
manifested. All that is taking place in all attempts to awaken the
Sonship is that That One is speaking to Itself. It speaks of awakening
because another aspect of Itself, another wave from the ocean, is yet
<em>pretending</em> that it has <em>truly</em> caused itself to lose awareness.</p>

<p>Look, then, around you, beloved friends. For once I asked you to
consider that you do not know what a single thing is, or is for. I did
this because you <em>believed</em> that you were a separate self, and that your
judgments and perceptions and definitions of things had a reality
<em>outside</em> of your mind. And therefore, I asked of you,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look around in perfect humility, for you do not know what a single thing
is, or is for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For if you look upon a brother or sister and see them as separate from
yourself, something or someone from which something can be acquired for
you to gain in your journey, you have truly not known what your brother
or sister is for. This is the only thing that your brother or sister <em>can</em>
be for: to be <em>that which God looks upon and sees only Himself</em>. A brother
or sister is in the field of awareness you have learned to call your own
for one reason: <em>to be loved, to be celebrated, to be joined with to
create and extend the good, the holy, and the beautiful</em>.</p>

<p>Does this mean that if you look upon another that they <em>ought</em> to get it?
Not at all. For That One that you are, manifesting through them, may
very well choose, in its infinite, perfect freedom, to remain wholly
insane. And so what? Nothing can prevent you from looking with Love and
allowing the play and display of form to continue its dance — birth and
death, joining and distancing, creating and dissolution. All things that
can be experienced must finally be allowed to flow without obstruction
within your mind. Birth gives rise to death, and death gives rise to
birth in a ceaseless display — not of something struggling <em>for</em> life, but
<em>as</em> Life, Itself.</p>

<p>The Reality of all that you are remains utterly changeless and pure. You
are as the sky through which all clouds dance and play. Your literal
moment-to-moment experience, even in the moment when you think you are
only a separate self that’s going to go bankrupt tomorrow because of
decisions made yesterday, even <em>that</em> can be allowed, can be trusted, can
be appreciated, can be witnessed from the spaciousness of the sky that
can embrace each cloud from a place of Perfect Knowing.</p>

<p>There can be no greater joy than to arrive in each moment with nothing
to be acquired, nothing to be accomplished, and <em>nothing to be resisted</em>.
When resistance has been released, through the simple choice to release
it, you will discover and know that all along, in Reality, there has
only been God.</p>

<!-- Track t6 -->

<p>How, then, does one live as they abide in True Knowledge? One could
simply answer,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any way they want to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For in unobstructed Life, That One is allowed to <em>in</em>form your choices.
There is no longer anything you believe you need, nothing you believe
will add something to you. For who by taking thought, who by taking
action, who by belief in theology, has ever added even one inch to their
stature? For though the body arises and passes away, as a brief cloud of
illusion in the Field of Creation, you remain unobstructed and vast. And
how can eternity be added unto? You are Pure Awareness. And nothing you
have ever done has increased you, just as nothing you have ever done has
taken anything away.</p>

<p>Each moment, then, is perfectly pristine and honest and innocent. Each
moment, embraced and allowed without obstruction, <em>is</em> the literal and
present state of Heaven. This is why I once said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heaven is spread across the face of the Earth, yet mankind sees it not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet, it requires Heaven to <em>choose</em> to see something else. This is the
slippery point upon which our final year together rests. And it is
slippery only because <em>it requires no effort</em>. You cannot help but be the
One showing up as the dance of a temporary play of energy that <em>appears</em>
to be separate from all other plays of energy. And yet, the Sonship is
One. Every tree, every drop of rain, every molecule, every thought,
every non-thought — these things are the Sonship. Is it not time to
awaken beyond a particular language that speaks only to <em>humanity</em>?</p>

<p>Remember that your suffering has come only from the illusion that you
are a separate body-mind subject to the ravages of time, the
insecurities of the world, surely to become a victim of death. The whole
time, in Reality, you are the <em>power</em> by which you chose that belief! Does
this mean that you can merely say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am awake now and I don’t need to feel that feeling that’s coming up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all! For Love does not resist <em>anything</em>. Love <em>embraces</em> all things.
Love <em>desires</em> all things. Love <em>awakens</em> to the Truth that only God is, and
God would embrace the totality of His Creation <em>through</em> you, <em>as</em> you, <em>in</em>
you, <em>for</em> you and for Himself! For there is no difference between God and
you. <em>You are That One.</em></p>

<p>How, then, does an Awakened One live? I gave you the answer earlier: any
way that that Awakened One wants to! And here now, please understand, we
come to the <em>essence</em> of what we’ll be doing this year. For no longer will
we live in questions about what we <em>ought</em> to do. No longer will I ask you
to live in questions of what went wrong, but rather, in the purity of
the power of the one question that God dwells in constantly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WHAT DO I WANT?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For here, in perfect surrender, is the mind returned to pure desire —
not the desire to gain for a separate self, but that which expresses the
totality of God.</p>

<p>What do I want?</p>

<p>is the question that God asks Himself <em>as you</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, it does mean you are perfectly free to enjoy the field of desire.
Are you capable of knowing what you truly want? Absolutely, once you
decide that you are not what you once believed you were. This requires
only the decision to recognize that nothing can exist save God, and
that, therefore, you are That One. You are whole and free — NOW!</p>

<p>I have often hinted to you that the totality of my life was <em>my journey</em>
back to God. I chose it freely, not because I was separate from God, but
because I had already awakened to the Truth that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What could possibly exist except the Love of God?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I chose, then, to look upon the body-mind and live only in the
question,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do I want?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And one thing I chose was to demonstrate the <em>unreality</em> of death.</p>

<p>What will <em>you</em> choose to demonstrate? For see not in my demonstration
something grand and beyond you, but rather, see that everything you
demonstrate is <em>equal to</em> that same power. For it <em>flows</em> from that power,
it <em>abides</em> in that power, it <em>manifests</em> that power, it <em>is</em> the Living
Breath and Reality of God!</p>

<!-- Track t7 -->

<p>And therefore, as we continue through this year, we will begin to focus
attention in the <em>perfect freedom</em> of exploring what is wanted. For the
Awakened Mind sees that in truly living in divine selfishness, you
cannot help but dance perfectly with your brother or sister, regardless
of how <em>they</em> are choosing to respond to you. It is impossible to be
separate one from another. It is impossible to cause another suffering.
It is impossible not to be One with the one before you. There is only
the dance and the play of Creation. There is only the celebration of
God’s Eternal Reality. There is only the recognition that God is Joy and
not depression. All depression stems from <em>resistance</em>, the obstruction of
the flow of awareness, the attempt to limit the unlimited.</p>

<p>The mind that allows all things, trusts all things, embraces all things
— <em>is</em> all things. And yet, though, you will seem to live, yet you will
not live. But That One alone lives as you. You are free. You are vast.
You are without birth and without death. You are as I am. You are the
Awakened One, the Anointed, the Messiah. You are the gentle touch of
Love in a temporary illusion, attempting to be other than Love. And why
not? It’s all a simple game, a simple play — an innocent illusion.</p>

<p>And therefore, indeed, we will end this hour with this one question that
we would ask you to live within between now and the time we next
communicate with you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beloved friend, O Holy One: WHAT DO YOU WANT?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And is that wanting generated by the freedom of Love or by the
ridiculous creation of a useless fear? Want only from freedom and you
will have your desire.</p>

<p>And with that, beloved friends, peace be unto you always. We are most
certainly going to enjoy this year with you. Go, then, in peace.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
