    <p>32.1 The experience of the Self is God. It is not from God. It is not of
God. It is God.</p>

<p>32.2 If all of life is the oneness that is God and God has chosen to
experience that oneness through relationship, then you are also that
experience and are in relationship with God through that experience.</p>

<p>32.3 Here we must revisit the concepts of oneness and manyness for if
you retain any notions of God that are inaccurate, they will arise here.</p>

<p>32.4 Let us discuss, for a moment, the concept of God because everyone
has at least some sort of concept of God.</p>

<p>32.5 First we will look at the concept of God as Supreme Being—God as
one being, one entity. When thought of in such a way, it is somewhat
easier to relate to God than when God is thought of in broader terms.
You might think of God as you think of yourself. When thinking of the
ideas put forth here, you might think of God deciding to know Himself.
You might think of God deciding to create. You might think of God
creating. You might think of God granting free will to His creations.
Then, perhaps, you might think of God resting, or standing back and
witnessing the unfolding of all that He created.</p>

<p>32.6 What would the purpose of this be? Would God be standing back,
judging Himself on the goodness of what He created? Thinking that He’d
like to make adjustments here or there, perhaps, but no, He has already
granted free will so He can’t do that? If the original purpose was
knowing Himself, what kind of knowing would this provide? Wouldn’t this
suggest a situation similar to a parent thinking he or she could know
him-or herself through observation of the children they produced?</p>

<p>32.7 Another concept of God is that of Creator. This concept might have
nothing to do with the notion of God wanting to know Himself. This
concept may be quite amorphous and not tremendously different than
scientific notions of the source of life. Whether it be called God or
the Big Bang or evolution, this notion presents the concept of something
being begun and then turned loose, proceeding from its beginnings under
scientific or natural laws.</p>

<p>32.8 Another idea of God within the concept of a Creator God is of God
existing in all of what has been created. God is, within this concept,
seen as the spirit within all that lives and also seen as an overriding
spirit, a force, a unifying factor. God is closer, within this idea, to
being a participatory being, but still falls short. Man lives and has
free will. Animals abide by the laws of nature. God is still a concept.</p>

<p>32.9 Yet most religious beliefs encompass the concept of a living God.
How might God live? Could He live in time and space in a dimension we
know not? Does He live as the spirit within us, and as such have some
small role, perhaps akin to that of what we refer to as our conscience?
What kind of life would this be? A difficult to imagine life at the very
least.</p>

<p>32.10 A concept of God is not necessary. False concepts of God, however,
are compromising to God and to Self.</p>

<p>32.11 Jesus spoke to you of his life as an example life. Jesus was
called the Son of God and also God. Those who understand the meaning of
any or all of the example lives that have come as revelations of who God
is, understand that those lives were not separate from God.</p>

<p>32.12 Yet to believe that God is everyone can still make you feel as if
you are not God. How can this be? This can be only because in your
contemplation of this idea, you lose your sense of self. There is a
rebellion, a negation of either the self or God that occurs when these
two concepts—concepts of the self and of God—cannot be reconciled or
joined in harmony. Either the self or God takes precedence in all lives.
All lives. There is no other choice as long as the self and God are seen
as separate.</p>

<p>32.13 Whether God is seen as Creator or Supreme Being, God is still seen
as the All Powerful. While God is seen as the All Powerful, man is
disenfranchised. Even while God is perhaps seen in all things, or as the
spirit by which all that lives, lives, God is still seen as having what
man has not. The list of what one can imagine makes God powerful and man
not could be endless, just as one could make an endless list of what
they believe differentiates God from man. The example lives in which the
power of God was demonstrated in the lives of men and women are seen as
little more than pass-through situations in which the power of God
passed through men and women to other men and women.</p>

<p>32.14 Only Jesus was known as the Son of God and as God. This is why
Jesus came as your teacher and was used as the example life for this
work. This is the point that this work has striven to get across. That
man and God are one. Not only is man God. But God is man and woman and
child. God is.</p>

<p>32.15 And yet, God could not be all that is, or God would not be in
relationship. If the natural world around you has revealed anything to
you of the nature of life and God, it has revealed to you the truth of
relationship. As has been said before, if separation had severed
relationship, then separation would truly exist. Each entity or being
would be singular and alone. Yet God has been referred to as the All of
All. How could God be the All of All and not also be man? How can God be
all that is and at the same time not all that is? How can God be the All
Powerful and Living God and also be lowly and powerless man?</p>

<p>32.16 God has also been referred to within this work as relationship
itself. Let us consider this idea newly by considering God’s
relationship to Jesus.</p>

<p>32.17 The claimed relationship of God to Jesus was that of Father to Son
but also as one in being. One in being, but different in relationship.</p>

<p>32.18 Could God be one in being, but different in relationship, to each
of us? Could not God’s oneness of being be the consciousness we all
share? Could not God’s relationship to everything be what differentiates
God from us and us from God? So that we are both one in being and
different? Could it be that while we are one in being with God we can
also become more god-like through the practice of holy relationship?
Could not the instructions that you have been given—such as those of
access to unity, and becoming a spacious Self, and the means that have
been used—such as the two levels of experience you have achieved during
the days and nights of our time together, be attempts to show you how
you can be more like unto God in relationship, even while you are God in
being?</p>

<p>32.19 Would this answer your questions concerning how God is both
different and the same? Would this answer your questions concerning
God’s great power when compared to your own? Could you see that God’s
power stems from His relationship to everything rather than from His
being? This is the easiest way to say this, if not quite accurate. Being
is power. But being, like oneness, cannot know itself without
relationship. You are one in being with your Father, with God, with the
Creator and with all of creation. You are also, however, a being that
exists in relationship. The extent of your ability to be in relationship
is the extent of your ability to be god-like.</p>

<p>32.20 God is the being and the relationship. You are capable of all the
power of God’s being but you are powerful only as God is powerful—in
relationship. Because God is in relationship with everything, God is All
Powerful. Because you are in a state of limited relationship, you have
limited power. This is the difference between God and man. This
difference, however, can be diminished as you embrace holy relationship.
As you embrace holy relationship you can become powerful as God is
powerful.</p>
