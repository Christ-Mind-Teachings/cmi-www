<p>You who feel threatened by this changing world, its twists of fortune
and its bitter jests, its brief relationships and all the “gifts” it
merely lends to take away again, attend this lesson well. The world
provides no safety. It is rooted in attack, and all its “gifts” of
seeming safety are illusory deceptions. It attacks and then attacks
again. No peace of mind is possible where danger threatens thus.</p>

<p>The world gives rise but to defensiveness. For threat brings anger,
anger makes attack seem reasonable, honestly provoked, and righteous in
the name of self-defense. Yet is defensiveness a double threat. For it
attests to weakness, and sets up a system of defense that cannot work.
Now are the weak still further undermined, for there is treachery
without and still a greater treachery within. The mind is now confused,
and knows not where to turn to find escape from its imaginings.</p>

<p>It is as if a circle held it fast, wherein another circle bound it, and
another in that one, until escape no longer can be hoped for nor
obtained. Attack, defense; defense, attack, become the circles of the
hours and the days that bind the mind in heavy bands of steel with iron
overlaid, returning but to start again. There seems to be no break nor
ending in the ever-tightening grip of imprisonment upon the mind.</p>

<p>Defenses are the costliest of all the prices which the ego would exact.
In them lies madness in a form so grim that hope of sanity seems but to
be an idle dream, beyond the possible. The sense of threat the world
encourages is so much deeper and so far beyond the frenzy and intensity
of which you can conceive that you have no idea of all the devastation
it has wrought. You are its slave. You know not what you do in fear of
it. You do not understand how much you have been made to sacrifice who
feel its iron grip upon your heart.</p>

<p>You do not realize what you have done to sabotage the holy peace of God
by your defensiveness. For you behold the Son of God as but a victim to
attack by fantasies, by dreams, and by illusions he has made; yet
helpless in their presence, needful only of defense by
still more fantasies and dreams by which illusions of his safety comfort
him.</p>

<p>Defenselessness is strength. It testifies to recognition of the Christ
in you. Perhaps you will recall the course maintains that choice is
always made between His strength and your own weakness seen apart from
Him. Defenselessness can never be attacked because it recognizes
strength so great attack is folly, or a silly game a tired child might
play when he becomes too sleepy to remember what he wants.</p>

<p>Defensiveness is weakness. It proclaims you have denied the Christ and
come to fear His Father’s anger. What can save you now from your
delusion of an angry god whose fearful image you believe you see at work
in all the evils of the world? What but illusions could defend you now,
when it is but illusions which you fight?</p>

<p>We will not play such childish games today. For our true purpose is to
save the world, and we would not exchange for foolishness the endless
joy our function offers us. We would not let our happiness slip by
because a senseless fragment of a dream happened to cross our minds, and
we mistook the figures in it for the Son of God; its tiny instant for
eternity.</p>

<p>We look past dreams today, and recognize that we need no defense because
we are created unassailable, without all thought or wish or dream in
which attack has any meaning. Now we cannot fear, for we have left all
fearful thoughts behind. And in defenselessness we stand secure,
serenely certain of our safety now, sure of salvation; sure we will
fulfill our chosen purpose as our ministry extends its holy blessing
through the world.</p>

<p>Be still a moment, and in silence think how holy is your purpose, how
secure you rest, untouchable within its light. God’s ministers have
chosen that the truth be with them. Who is holier than they? Who could
be surer that his happiness is fully guaranteed? And who could be more
mightily protected? What defense could possibly be needed by the ones
who are among the chosen ones of God by His election and their own as
well?</p>

<p>It is the function of God’s ministers to help their brothers choose as
they have done. God has elected all, but few have come to realize His
Will is but their own. And while you fail to teach what you have learned
salvation waits, and darkness holds the world in
grim imprisonment. Nor will you learn that light has come to you, and
your escape has been accomplished. For you will not see the light until
you offer it to all your brothers. As they take it from your hands, so
will you recognize it as your own.</p>

<p>Salvation can be thought of as a game that happy children play. It was
designed by One Who loves His children, and Who would replace their
fearful toys with joyous games which teach them that the game of fear is
gone. His game instructs in happiness because there is no loser.
Everyone who plays must win, and in his winning is the gain to everyone
ensured. The game of fear is gladly laid aside when children come to see
the benefits salvation brings.</p>

<p>You who have played that you are lost to hope, abandoned by your Father,
left alone in terror in a fearful world made mad by sin and guilt, be
happy now. That game is over. Now a quiet time has come in which we put
away the toys of guilt, and lock our quaint and childish thoughts of sin
forever from the pure and holy minds of Heaven’s children and the Son of
God. We pause but for a moment more, to play our final happy game upon
this earth. And then we go to take our rightful place where truth abides
and games are meaningless.</p>

<p>So is the story ended. Let this day bring the last chapter closer to the
world, that everyone may learn the tales he reads of terrifying destiny,
defeat of all his hopes, his pitiful defense against a vengeance he can
not escape, was but his own deluded fantasy. God’s ministers have come
to waken him from the dark dreams this story has evoked in his confused,
bewildered memory of this distorted tale. God’s Son can smile at last,
on learning that it is not true.</p>

<p>Today we practice in a form we will maintain for quite a while. We will
begin each day by giving our attention to the daily thought as long as
possible. Five minutes now becomes the least we give to preparation for
a day in which salvation is the only goal we have. Ten would be better;
fifteen better still. And as distraction ceases to arise to turn us from
our purpose, we will find that half an hour is too short a time to spend
with God. Nor will we willingly give less at night in gratitude and joy.</p>

<p>Each hour adds to our increasing peace, as we remember to be faithful to
the Will we share with God. At times, perhaps, a minute,
even less, will be the most that we can offer as the hour strikes.
Sometimes we will forget. At other times the business of the world will
close on us, and we will be unable to withdraw a little while and turn
our thoughts to God.</p>

<p>Yet when we can, we will observe our trust as ministers of God in hourly
remembrance of our mission and His Love. And we will quietly sit by and
wait on Him and listen to His Voice, and learn what He would have us do
the hour that is yet to come; while thanking Him for all the gifts He
gave us in the one gone by.</p>

<p>In time, with practice, you will never cease to think of Him, and hear
His loving Voice guiding your footsteps into quiet ways where you will
walk in true defenselessness. For you will know that Heaven goes with
you. Nor would you keep your mind away from Him a moment, even though
your time is spent in offering salvation to the world. Think you He will
not make this possible for you who chose to carry out His plan for the
salvation of the world and yours?</p>

<p>Today our theme is our defenselessness. We clothe ourselves in it as we
prepare to meet the day. We rise up strong in Christ, and let our
weakness disappear as we remember that His strength abides in us. We
will remind ourselves that He remains beside us through the day, and
never leaves our weakness unsupported by His strength.</p>

<p>We call upon His strength each time we feel the threat of our defenses
undermine our certainty of purpose. We will pause a moment, as He tells
us, “I am here.”Your practicing will now begin to take the earnestness
of love to help you keep your mind from wandering from its intent.</p>

<p>Be not afraid or timid. There can be no doubt that you will reach your
final goal. The ministers of God can never fail, because the love and
strength and peace that shine from them to all their brothers come from
Him. These are His gifts to you. Defenselessness is all you need to give
Him in return. You lay aside but what was never real, to look on Christ
and see His sinlessness.</p>
