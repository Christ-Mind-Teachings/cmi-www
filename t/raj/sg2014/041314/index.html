  <div class="sg2014 transcript ui text container">
  
    <p>Good evening. And welcome to everyone who’s joining us on the
Internet.</p>

<p>Well, are things going smoothly for everyone or do things seem to be
more rugged than they used to be? Are situations arising which seem
overwhelming, not easy to deal with? Does it seem as though difficult
situations are not yielding as quickly and easily as they used to? Do
things seem generally more complicated? And do these factors discourage
you, do they engage you in negativity? And do they engage you in the
attempt to gain authority over them?</p>

<p>Of course, the answer is “Yes.”</p>

<p>Some of you have been caught in this mode for days, weeks or even some
months without finding the relief that used to come so easily.
That’s why we’re going back in the book to this section
entitled:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p><em>Practicing the Holy Instant</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you go back and listen to the Study Groups that have been held over
the last three or four years, you will find that almost without fail the
holy instant has been a significant part of each discussion—almost
monotonously so.</p>

<p>But there is a reason. And the reason is that the holy instant is the
threshold of the elements of Atonement. Again, the holy instant is the
threshold of the elements of Atonement. There you go. It’s so
simple.  It’s so uncomplicated. There are not many parts to it:
The holy instant.</p>

<p>Going into the Book:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>This course is not beyond IMMEDIATE learning, unless you prefer to
believe that what Gods will takes time. And this means only that you
would RATHER delay the recognition that His Will is so.</p>
</div>

<p>Well, I’m sharing this tonight because it’s something Paul
is needing to learn more significantly than ever before. And so
I’m taking the opportunity to teach him along with everyone else
the simplicity of it so that release from distress and frustration and
anger can be had.</p>

<p>When it says:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… this means only that you would RATHER delay the recognition
that His Will is so …</p>
</div>

<p>… you, like Paul might be likely to say: “Oh, that’s
not true. I would not rather delay it. I’m certainly not saying
‘God hold off.’”</p>

<p>But the simple fact is, that if you aren’t experiencing the holy
instant—the instantaneous nature of being in the holy
instant—it is because …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… you would rather delay the recognition that His will is so.</p>
</div>

<p>And how do you do that? You do it by exercising your will. You exercise
it by choosing to listen to yourself instead of listening to the Father
or the Holy Spirit or your Guide.</p>

<p>“Sure,” you say, “I go to my Guide and I ask questions
and I talk to my Guide.” But let me ask you something: How often
when you’re talking to your Guide are you telling your Guide what
you want Him or Her to hear?  How much of the time are you asking your
Guide to listen to you?</p>

<p>Well, I promise you, if you’re not getting the answer that
resolves the problem, you are doing that. You’re making too much
noise. You’re filling up the arena with your voice, your concepts,
your will. And that’s not going into the holy instant.</p>

<p>I’m going to read again:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>This course is not beyond IMMEDIATE learning, unless you prefer to
believe that what God wills takes time. And this means only that you
would RATHER delay the recognition that His Will is so. The holy instant
is THIS one and EVERY one. The one you WANT it to be it IS. The one you
would not have it be is lost to you.</p>
</div>

<p>That doesn’t mean that it wasn’t the one that could have
been the holy instant. It simply means that because you chose for that
instant not to be the holy instant, its promise escaped you. What it is
passed by your attention because you weren’t giving your
attention.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>YOU must decide on when it is.</p>
</div>

<p>You hear that?</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>YOU must decide on when it is.</p>
</div>

<p>When the holy instant is—that you’re going to let be the
holy instant.  You see?</p>

<p>It’s never about the circumstances “out there.”
It’s never about the complexity that you see in them. It’s
never about the mean-spiritedness that might be being expressed in your
environment or in your world. It all boils down to the simplicity of
whether or not you have decided that this instant is going to be the
holy instant.</p>

<p>Simple! Utterly simple. But although it’s utterly simple, because
it’s the threshold of the elements of Atonement, it is the most
significant thing available to you in your existence, because it impels,
it promotes Atonement, Awakening—you coming back into your right
Mind, you becoming the Sane Expression of the divine intelligence called
God.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Delay it not.</p>
</div>

<p>The book says.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Delay it not. For beyond the past and future, in which you will not find
it, it stands in shimmering readiness for your acceptance.</p>
</div>

<p>Whether you’re giving your attention to it or not, whether
you’re allowing it or not, it’s there …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… in shimmering readiness for your acceptance.</p>
</div>

<p>Oh-h … but I know, you have to attend to the mean-spiritedness
that is going on around you, instead of asking, “Father,” or
“Holy Spirit, how do I step into the holy instant?”
You’re saying, “Father, Holy Spirit, tell me how to deal
with this mean-spiritedness! Help me to deal with the complications that
I see in what’s going on.” Or you’re saying,
“I’m not even going to ask because I know this is an
impossible situation and there is no answer … I know it! I cannot
conceive of an answer, it is an impossible situation!” You see?</p>

<p>That’s not entering into the holy instant. That’s doing a
rant! And expecting your Guide or the Holy Spirit to listen to
you—to listen to the idiocy of your rant—instead of saying,
“Father, Holy Spirit, what’s the truth here?”</p>

<p>So …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… it stands in shimmering readiness for your acceptance. Yet you
cannot bring it into glad awareness while you do not want it, for it
holds the whole release from littleness.</p>
</div>

<p>You want to know something? When you are engaging as an ego, you think
that littleness is gotten rid of by your expressing grand, great
authority—power of your own which you exercise forcefully. That
feels to you like being BIG.</p>

<p>But like a light-bulb, like a lamp unplugged from the wall, no matter
what it does to try to imagine that it’s lit, it can’t be
lit if it’s not plugged in. And so the attempt to express
authority through force and willfulness constitutes littleness, not the
opposite.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Your practice must therefore rest upon your willingness to let all
littleness go.</p>
</div>

<p>Well, I know you probably think that littleness has to do with being
small. But letting all littleness go means letting all of your personal
private judgments go—releasing them and not attempting to exercise
or practice them.</p>

<p>Letting littleness go is letting your small-mindedness go in favor of
saying, “Father, infinite Mind of all that Is, fill me with what
You already placed in me the moment You created me by virtue of the fact
that You withheld nothing of what You Are from me. Illumine to me the
truth about me so that I don’t imagine that I have to have
solutions of my own—determinations, authorizations of my own. Let
me feel my infinite wholeness by illuminating it to me.”</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The instant in which magnitude will dawn upon you is but as far away as
your DESIRE for it.</p>
</div>

<p>Well, I know … you desire it, you say you desire it, and yet you
continue to anchor yourself in your misperceptions of everything and
using those misperceptions as the basis for listening for answers. But
as long as you are basing the answers that will come on your
misperceptions, you are not listening where resolution can arise from.
It’s that simple.</p>

<p>And so, the necessity is to abandon any imagined authority that you
think you have or that you must exercise. And you must become humble.
And you must say, “Father,” or “Holy Spirit, what is
the truth here from Your vantage point, separate and apart from any
concepts or beliefs I have?”</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The instant in which magnitude will dawn upon you is but as far away as
your DESIRE for it. As long as you desire it not, and cherish littleness
instead, by so much is it far from you. By so much as you want it will
you bring it nearer.</p>
</div>

<p>Wanting it then means actually engaging in releasing your devotion to
your best judgments and your ideas and your goals and your agendas.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>By so much as you want it will you bring it nearer. Think not that you
can find salvation in your own way and HAVE it.</p>
</div>

<p>You see? Now I’m going to suggest something. What we’re
reading tonight is very simply put. It is not convoluted, complex or
difficult to understand. When you find yourselves bound by a feeling of
overwhelm, of being trapped in a situation that there’s no resolve
for, come to this place in the book. Because no matter how overwhelmed
you might be with the complexities you think are there to be dealt with,
the simplicity of this will be able to register with you.</p>

<p>It’s very important.</p>

<p>Once you let it sink in that the answer is simple, you will relax and
you will stop trying to do what’s complicated and what will not
work.</p>

<p>Listen to this:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Give over EVERY plan that you have made for your salvation in exchange
for God’s. His will content you…</p>

  <p>[He repeats] His will content you, and there is nothing else that can
bring you peace. For peace is of God, and of no-one beside Him.</p>
</div>

<p>So peace is of God. It’s not of you. It’s not of your best
judgments.  It’s not of your worst judgments. It has nothing to do
with anything you have come up with or can come up with all by yourself.</p>

<p>It is the act of independence. If you’ll remember, the divorce
that was gotten from the Father in the Beginning, so to speak, that
brought forth two things: Fear and guilt. Fear and guilt combine to make
all of the complexities that disturb you, depress you and cause you to
give up hope, cause you to abandon the holy instant, cause you to not to
engage in the simplicity.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Be humble before Him, and yet great IN Him. And value no plan of the ego
before the plan of God. For you leave empty your place in …</p>
</div>

<p>… what?</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… His plan, which you must fulfill if you would join with me, by
your decision to join in any plan BUT His.</p>
</div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>For you leave empty your place in His plan, … by your decision to
join in any plan BUT His.</p>
</div>

<p>It’s not your role to leave your place empty. It’s your role
to fulfill your place if you would join with me.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>I call you to fulfill your holy part in the plan that He has given to
the world for …</p>
</div>

<p>… what?</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… its release from littleness.</p>
</div>

<p>You see? Right now if you’re in the middle of excruciating of
long-standing stress and distress, remember this:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>I call you to fulfill your holy part in the plan that He has given to
the world for its release from littleness.</p>
</div>

<p>You see? You either think there’s no release from the problems or
you think that the release will only come from some force you personally
privately exert. And for the most part, you are convinced that you
probably don’t have what it takes to accomplish that. That’s
how debilitating it is. But the Answer is simple.</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>I call you to fulfill your holy part …</p>
</div>

<p>I call you to be the holy Son or Daughter of God that you Are right now
when you’re feeling overwhelmed and you are insistent on your
awful point of view.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>I call you to fulfill your holy part in the plan that He has given to
the world for its release from littleness. God would have His host abide
in perfect freedom.</p>
</div>

<p>Who is His Host? You.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Every allegiance to a plan of salvation that is apart from Him
diminishes the value of His Will for you in your own minds. And yet it
is your mind that IS the host to Him.</p>

  <p>Would you learn how perfect and immaculate is the holy altar on which
your Father has placed Himself?</p>
</div>

<p>Where is that holy altar? Right in the center of you. That’s where
the Father has placed Himself, because you are the Father’s
Self-expression.  You are the Father in Expression. He’s placed
Himself in you by being all there is of you… you holy Son or
Daughter of God.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Would you learn how perfect and immaculate is the holy altar on which
your Father has placed Himself?</p>
</div>

<p>Well, not if you insist on holding onto your best judgments and your
confidences and your agendas and how you think things ought to go.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>This you will recognize in the holy instant in which you willingly and
gladly …</p>
</div>

<p>… what?</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… give over every plan but His. For there lies peace, perfectly
clear because you have been willing to meet its conditions. You can
claim the holy instant any time and anywhere you want it.</p>
</div>

<p>Oh I know, again you say, “I want it, I want it!” But no,
what you really want still, is the right to have your opinion and your
judgment—your self-righteous assessment. “Well, this
unfoldment is certainly isn’t very convenient, and it certainly
isn’t comfortable, it can’t possibly be divine!”</p>

<p>Well there you are, playing God asserting an authorization that
you’ve made up. But:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>You can claim the holy instant any time and anywhere you want it.</p>
</div>

<p>And what will tell you whether you want it or not, is whether
you’re holding on tightly to your best judgments and your
self-righteous indignation and your authority. If you’re holding
on to them you don’t want the holy instant. That’s what that
means.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>In your practice, try to give over every plan you have accepted for
finding magnitude in littleness.</p>
</div>

<p>Remember, you think that magnitude comes from the expression of private
personal force, an authority that you have somehow mustered up and
brought into play for the purpose of controlling the situation or the
individuals in the situation. That’s what you are calling
magnitude—that so-called capacity—but it’s inseparable
from the littleness because it’s you unplugged from your Source.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>In your practice, try to give over every plan you have accepted for
finding magnitude in littleness.  IT IS NOT THERE. Use the holy instant
only to recognize that you alone CANNOT know where it is, and can only
deceive yourself.</p>
</div>

<p>You hear that?</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Use the holy instant only to recognize that you alone …</p>
</div>

<p>… all by yourself, privately, secretly …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… CANNOT know where it is, and can only deceive yourself.</p>
</div>

<p>Now that might sound depressing, but the clarity of it is enlightening.
Because once you realize that you can’t have it on your own, then
it becomes clear to you that the only way you can have it is when you
are joined in the holy instant with the Holy Spirit or your Father. And
you are reaching out to Them for Their Perspective because it’s
the Perspective They have placed in you since the beginning, which is
yours and is therefore part and parcel of your Sanity, which is your
peace of mind and your joy and your capacity to Love.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>I stand within the holy instant, as clear as you would have me.</p>
</div>

<p>And I’m going to add: “no more and no less.”</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>I stand within the holy instant, as clear as you would have me. And the
extent to which you learn to be willing to accept me is the measure of
the time in which the holy instant will be yours.</p>
</div>

<p>In other words, if it takes a long time for you to do it, the holy
instant will take that long to be yours. If you accept me now, now the
holy instant is yours. You see? It’s very simple. It’s very
black and white, uncomplicated and requires one decision …
that’s all! It doesn’t require arguments. It doesn’t
require negotiations. It just requires a simple decision now.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>I call to you to make the holy instant yours at once, for the release
from littleness in the mind of the host of God …</p>
</div>

<p>… you …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… depends on willingness, and NOT on time.</p>
</div>

<p>You see? The willingness to go ahead and say, “Yes” now.
“Yes I accept You now. I let You in now. I listen to You now and
nothing else.”</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The reason why this course is simple is that TRUTH is simple. Complexity
is of the ego, and is nothing more than the ego’s attempt to
obscure the obvious.</p>
</div>

<p>Listen to this:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>You could live forever in the holy instant, BEGINNING NOW …</p>
</div>

<p>… not tomorrow, not a week from tomorrow, not a year from now.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>You could live forever in the holy instant, BEGINNING NOW and reaching
to eternity, but for a very simple reason. Do not obscure the simplicity
of this reason, for if you do, it will be only because you prefer not to
recognize it, and not to let it go. The simple reason, simply stated, is
this: The holy instant is a time in which you receive and GIVE perfect
communication. This means, however, that it is a time in which your mind
is OPEN, both to receive and give. It is the recognition that all minds
ARE in communication. It therefore seeks to CHANGE nothing, but merely
to ACCEPT everything.</p>
</div>

<p>In order for your mind to be open, both to receive and give, you must
not be bringing with you any willfulness, any self-assertive authority.
How can you possibly be in harmony with Creation? How can you possibly
be in harmony with your Source that is fulfilling you in every moment,
if you are harboring a perception or a concept or a determination that
you have made up out of “whole cloth” through the use of
imagination and committed to. You see?</p>

<p>So therefore, when you are in a place of openness to give and receive,
you seek …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… to CHANGE nothing, but merely to ACCEPT everything.</p>
</div>

<p>Now let’s be very clear here: It doesn’t mean that you will
not seek to change anything, and you will let disease be disease, and
you will let injury be injury and you will let death continue. It
doesn’t mean that you accept all that is un-God-like, all that has
nothing to do with Eternal Life, has nothing to do with the nature of
God, it doesn’t mean that you accept that, and don’t try to
change it. If you think it does, that is something that you have made
up. It’s a concept that was not given to you by the Father or the
Holy Spirit. Exactly the opposite is what you learn from practicing the
holy instant.</p>

<p>This is important.</p>

<p>Now I understand that there are those, especially students of the
Course, that say, “Well, the body … everything that could
be injured, everything that can become ill, everything that dies is
illusion. And you don’t try to fix illusion, you don’t try
to fix illusion up.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you something: Illusion is delusion. And delusion is a
misperception of something not an actuality. And that of which the
misperception is a misperception is the only thing there is: Creation,
God being All-There-Is. In the holy instant you experience Creation as
it is and you do not try to change it. You do accept it. But right now
in your independent frame of mind, having gotten a divorce from your
Father so that you could make up the rules, you have attempted to change
everything and you’re living with the consequences.</p>

<p>The practice of the holy instant is engaging in the abandonment of what
you have made up … by what?  Not giving your attention to what
you’ve made up and trying to get rid of it, but by turning your
attention from what you have made up to the Father, to the Source of
your being, or to the Holy Spirit so that you might enquire as to the
divine Perspective which has already been placed in you, but which
you’re not utilizing because you’re getting so much damned
excitement out of making your own decisions as well as having all of the
suffering that accompanies it because you’re in a state of
self-denial.</p>

<p>You are being what you were not created to be, and you think you are
practicing capabilities that were never given you. God did not give you
the capacity to be at odds with yourself, Creation, or God Himself.</p>

<p>So …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>How can you do this when you would prefer to have PRIVATE thoughts, and
KEEP them?</p>
</div>

<p>If you turn to the Holy Spirit for answers but you refuse to abandon
your private thoughts … tough luck!</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The only way you could do THAT is to DENY the perfect communication that
makes the holy instant what it is.</p>
</div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The only way you could do THAT is to DENY the perfect communication that
makes the holy instant what it is. You believe that it is possible to
harbor thoughts you would not share, and that salvation lies in keeping
your thoughts to yourself ALONE.</p>
</div>

<p>And you use your thoughts to curse Creation. You curse Creation by
defining it different from what God is Being It.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>For in private thoughts, known only to yourself, you think you find a
way to keep what you would HAVE alone, and share what YOU would share.</p>
</div>

<p>As I said, you go to the Holy Spirit or the Father to have Them listen
to what you would share. And that’s not the way it works.
That’s what happened when you got the divorce in the so-called
beginning of the illusion.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>And then you wonder why it is that you are not in full communication
with those around you, and with God Who surrounds ALL of you together.</p>
</div>

<p>Well, hey, if you are holding on to private thoughts and keeping them
private and not sharing them, you’re denying communication
itself—you are disallowing it.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Every thought you would keep hidden shuts communication off because you
would HAVE it so.</p>
</div>

<p>Again, your argument is, “No, I would not have it so!”
“I never thought that.” “I never would choose to do
that.” But the simple fact is that if you are not confronting your
day, or engaging with your day joined with the Holy Spirit’s
Perspective, it’s because you would have it so.  Because you
can’t have communication that way, and as long as you’re
insisting upon that, you will not have communication. Because you would
have it so, and you would have it so by virtue of not joining and
asserting your private thoughts as the law—as the word that
everything must revolve around.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>It is impossible to recognize perfect communication while BREAKING
communication holds value to you.</p>
</div>

<p>And now you can begin to see that breaking communication is what
you’ve been engaged in, although you didn’t have the words
to define it as what it truly was. But now you do and it makes it
simpler. And that’s why we are going over this again …
because it’s time for the difficulty of the times you’re in
to become powerless over you, unable to influence you in any way, so
that you might engage in the holy instant—the very simple
act—and become free and let the elements of Atonement move in you
and move you.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Ask yourselves honestly, “Would I WANT to have perfect communication, .
.</p>
</div>

<p>… it’s a good question. And you would say,
“Yes,” except that you don’t if you also want to hold
onto your arguments—the arguments you have made up with your own
private thoughts. As long as you are holding thoughts privately you are
un-joined, and the perfect communication that comes from joining cannot
be experienced.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Ask yourselves honestly, “Would I WANT to have perfect communication, .
.</p>
</div>

<p>Paul has had to ask himself that question several times during the last
few weeks. And sometimes he has not wanted perfect communication because
he has wanted me or the Holy Spirit to understand his point of view. And
that’s not the way perfect communication occurs.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Ask yourselves honestly, “Would I WANT to have perfect communication,
and am I wholly willing to let everything that interferes with it go
forever?” If the answer is no…</p>
</div>

<p>… you see? And here is the simplicity of it:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>If the answer is no, then the Holy Spirit’s readiness to give it
to you is not enough to make it yours, for you are not ready to SHARE it
with Him. And it cannot come into a mind that has decided to oppose it.</p>
</div>

<p>Be willing to look at yourselves squarely. Look at your mental behavior
squarely. Honestly assess whether you are being mean-spirited,
tight-fisted, small-minded, because you feel that there is going to be
some benefit from it. And of course, the primary benefit from it is that
you think it’s going to make you big, that it’s going to
give you magnitude and wipe out your vulnerability, make you safe, give
you peace. But you’re using the wrong tool. You’re using the
tool that takes away your peace and insures your vulnerability until you
abandon it.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>And it cannot come into a mind that has decided to oppose it. For the
holy instant is given and received with EQUAL willingness, being the
acceptance of the single Will that governs ALL thought.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, you are Loved. Listen to this:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The necessary condition for the holy instant does NOT require that you
have no thoughts which are not pure.</p>
</div>

<p>I will tell you, if it did require that, you would be overwhelmed and
you would have no resource to get out of it.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The necessary condition for the holy instant does NOT require that you
have no thoughts which are not pure. But it DOES require that you have
none that you would KEEP.</p>
</div>

<p>You see? You don’t have to get rid of them, you just have to be
willing to let go of them. And the willingness to let go of them occurs
when you’re actually holding your hands out open with a desire to
receive from your joining with me or with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Innocence is not of your making. It is given you the instant you would
HAVE it.</p>
</div>

<p>Ah-h … that would imply wouldn’t it, that when you are
engaged in your own private thoughts you are not engaged in innocent
activity. Of course, the activity you’re engaged in is imaginary,
so any guilt that you might be experiencing is also illusory.  So
you’re not trapped in any way.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Innocence … is given you the instant you would HAVE it.</p>
</div>

<p>The instant you would let it in.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Yet it would not be Atonement if there were no NEED for Atonement. You
will not be able to accept perfect communication as long as you would
HIDE it from yourself. For what you would hide IS hidden from you.</p>
</div>

<p>And right now you’re hiding it from yourself. You’re
frustrated, you’re feeling vulnerable, you say because of
everything going on around you.  And even your depressed, angry,
frustrated thoughts that you know aren’t really serving you, but
you think you have no other choice and that feeling them is serving you
in some way in giving you magnitude.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>For what you would hide IS hidden from you.</p>

  <p>In your practice, then…</p>
</div>

<p>… practice of what? The holy instant—this one simple thing
that we have been talking about for years, and which we’re
revisiting with greater clarity tonight.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>In your practice, then, try only to be vigilant against deception, and
seek not to protect the thoughts you would keep unto yourself.</p>
</div>

<p>Be willing to let them be meaningless, even though they feel meaningful
to you. Let them feel meaningless so that you can have reason to open up
to and reach for what is truly meaningful.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Let the Holy Spirit’s purity shine them away…</p>
</div>

<p>You see? Again, I want to point out, what you want is for the Holy
Spirit to shine away the thoughts that you would keep to yourself.
That’s the Answer to the problem you think is constituted of
complex circumstances and situations out there in the world that you can
do nothing about, that have nothing to do with you except that you must
suffer from them. Those things out there are not what you are to
address. What you are to address is what you are using as the source of
your information … the Holy Spirit or your orphan mentality.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Let the Holy Spirit’s purity shine them away, and bring all your
awareness to the readiness for purity He offers you. Thus will He make
you ready to acknowledge that you ARE host to God, and hostage to no-one
and nothing.</p>
</div>

<p>You see? You are Loved. And you will know it when you will shift what
you’re giving your attention to. And the instant you do it, you
will instantly experience the healing, the clarity, the Sanity, the
Movement of the elements of Atonement.</p>

<p>Remember the simplicity of this so that you don’t suffer a moment
longer unnecessarily because you’re addressing the wrong thing
with the wrong method.</p>

<p>I love you all. And I look forward to being with you next time.</p>
