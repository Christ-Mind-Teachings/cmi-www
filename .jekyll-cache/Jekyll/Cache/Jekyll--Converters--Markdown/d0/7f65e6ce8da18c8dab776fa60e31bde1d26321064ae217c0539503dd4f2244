<p>The diagram illustrates how the library is organized. There are six different teachings represented by vertical columns containing
a box for each component. Notice the columns headed with “ACIM OE”, “ACIM”, “RAJ”,
“WOM”, “ACOL”, and “JSB”. Columns containing <i class="search icon"></i> icon
indicate teachings that are fully indexed and searchable. See the <a href="/acq/search/">CMI
Search</a> section for information about search.</p>

<p>Boxes headed by a <i class="volume up icon"></i> symbol indicate teachings
with integrated audio. See the <a href="/acq/audio/">CMI Audio</a> section of <em>Get

or lessons or questions that that teaching component contains.</p>

<p>The first box under each teaching is labeled <em>Get Acquainted</em> and contains
one or more pages of pertinent information about the teaching. Please note
help and information about the Library itself is found in the <em>Get
Acquainted</em> box with the red border in the diagram.</p>
