## User Accounts
{: .disable-paragraph-marker}

You can use the CMI Library without creating a user account and have full
access to all features except [Bookmarks and Annotations](/acq/bookmark).

See the [Bookmarks](/acq/bookmark) documentation for details on using bookmarks and annotations.

## Create An Account

You must first create an account before you can sign in. Start by clicking the
<i class="sign in icon"></i> icon in the menu bar.

<div class="ui container" markdown="1">
  ![Sign Up](/public/img/cmi/sign-up.jpg)
</div>

Click the Sign up tab, enter your name, email address, and password and the
press the "Sign up" button at the bottom of the window.

An email will be sent to the email address you entered. Click the link in the
email to continuing signing up.

<div class="ui container" markdown="1">
  ![Sign Up Email](/public/img/cmi/sign-up-email.jpg)
</div>

Click the link to confirm your email address. Unless you explicity sign out you
will be automatically signed in each time you enter the site.

When you hover the cursor over the <i class="sign out icon"></i> icon, which
shows green when your are signed in, your name and account specific features are shown.

<div class="ui container" markdown="1">
  ![Signed In](/public/img/cmi/signed-in.jpg)
</div>

## Signing In

Signing in is usually done automatically. You will need to sign in only when
you access the site with a new computer or after you explicitly sign out.

Easy.
