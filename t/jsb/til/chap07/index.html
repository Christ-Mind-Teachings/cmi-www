  <div class="til transcript ui text container">
  
    <p>I have said that man does not think; that it is I, within him, Who do
his thinking.</p>

<p>I have also said man thinks he thinks.</p>

<p>As this is an apparent contradiction, I must show you that man
ordinarily does not think, any more than he does anything else he
supposes he does.</p>

<p>For I, within him, do all that he does; but I necessarily do it
through his organism, through his personality, his body, mind and
soul.</p>

<p>I will point out how this can be.</p>

<p>First, try to realize that I made you in My Image and Likeness, and that
I have My Being within you. Even if you do not know this now and believe
that I, God, AM somewhere without, and that we are separated, try for
the time being to imagine I AM within you.</p>

<p>Next, realize that which you do when you think is not real thinking,
because it is not conscious thinking; for you are unconscious of Me,
the Inspirer and Director of every idea and thought that enters your
mind.</p>

<p>Next, realize because I AM within you, and you are My Image and
Likeness, and therefore possess all of My Faculties, you have the
power of thinking; but not being conscious that thinking is creating
and that it is one of My Divine Powers you are using you have indeed
all your life been thinking, but it has all been mis-thinking, or what
you would call error-thinking.</p>

<p>And this error-thinking, this not knowing it is My Power you have been
thus misusing, has been separating you in consciousness farther and
farther from Me; but all the time fulfilling My Purpose, which later
on will be made manifest to you.</p>

<p>The proof of this is, you think you are separated from Me, that you
are living in a material World, that your body of Flesh engenders and
harbors pleasure and pain, and that an evil influence, called the
Devil, is manifesting in the world, opposing My Will.</p>

<p>Yes, you think all these things are so.</p>

<p>They are to you, for all things are to manâ€™s mortal consciousness
what he thinks or believes they are.</p>

<p>I have likewise caused them to appear to man to be what he thinks they
are. This also is to suit My purpose, and to fulfill the law of
creating.</p>

<p>Let us see if this is not true.</p>

<p>If you believe a thing is so, is not that thing really so to you?</p>

<p>Is it not true that a thing seems real to you, like some sin or evil,
so-called, some sorrow, trouble or worry, only because your thinking
or believing it so makes it such? Others might see that thing entirely
differently and might think your view of it foolish. Might they not?</p>

<p>If this is true, then your body, your personality, your character,
your environment, your world, are what they appear to be to you,
because you have thought them into their present status.</p>

<p>Therefore you can change them by the same process, if they do not
please you; you can make them whatever you will, by thinking them so.
Can you not?</p>

<p>But how can one do real thinking, conscious thinking, so as to bring
about this change? You ask.</p>

<p>First know that I, your Real Self, purposely brought to your attention
these things which now are displeasing and which cause you to think
them as being what they now seem to be to you. I, and I alone, AM thus
preparing your human mind so that, when you turn within to Me in
abiding Faith and Trust, I can enable you to see and bring into outer
manifestation the Reality of these things which now seem so
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>For I bring to you everything that, by its outer seeming, can attract
or lure your human mind onward in its Earthly search, in order to
teach you of the illusoriness of all outer appearance of material
things to the human mind, and of the fallibility of all human
understanding; so that you will turn finally within to Me and My
Wisdom, as the One and Only Interpreter and Guide.</p>

<p>When you have turned thus within to Me, I will open your eyes and
cause you to see that the only way you can ever bring about this
change in thinking, is by first changing your attitude toward all
these things you now think are not what they ought to be.</p>

<p>That is, if they are unsatisfactory or obnoxious to you and affect you
so as to cause you discomfort of body or disturbance of mind, why,
stop thinking that they can so affect or disturb you.</p>

<p>For who is the master? Your body, your mind, or You, the I AM
within?</p>

<p>Then why not show You are master, by thinking the true things the I AM
of you within wishes you to think?</p>

<p>It is only by your thinking these other things, by allowing these
inharmonious thoughts to enter your mind and by so doing giving them
the power so to affect or disturb you, that they have any such
influence over you. When you stop thinking into them this power, and
turn within to Me and allow Me to direct your thinking, they will at
once disappear from your consciousness, and dissolve into the
nothingness from which you created them by your thinking.</p>

<p>When you are willing to do this, then and then only are you ready to
receive Truth, and, by proper conscious thinking, directed by Me, to
create the true and permanent things I within wish you to create.</p>

<p>Then, when you can thus distinguish the true from the false, the real
from the seeming, your conscious thinking will be as potent to create
all things you desire, as has been your unconsciousness thinking in
the past in creating those things you once desired but now find
obnoxious.</p>

<p>For it was by your unconscious thinking, or thinking unconscious of
the control your desires exercised over your creative power, that your
world and your life are now what you sometime in the past desired them
to be.</p>

<p>Have you ever studied and analyzed the process of the working of your
mind when a new Idea fertile with possibilities appears?</p>

<p>Have you noticed the relation that Desire bears to such an Idea, and
how, through thinking, that Idea is finally brought to actual
fruition?</p>

<p>Let us study this relation and process.</p>

<p>There is always first the Idea, not considering at this moment the
necessity or occasion for Its appearance. It matters not whence the
Idea comes, from within or without; for it is always I who inspire It
or cause It to impress your consciousness at the particular moment it
does.</p>

<p>Then, just to the extent that you grow quiet and focus your attention
upon that Idea, stilling all the activities of your mind and eliminating
all other ideas and thoughts from your consciousness, so that Idea can
have full sway, do I illumine your mind and cause to unfold before your
mental gaze the various phases and possibilities contained within that
Idea.</p>

<p>This takes place, however, up to this point, without any volition on
your part, other than focusing or concentrating your attention upon the
Idea.</p>

<p>Once I have given your human mind a view of Its possibilities, and
have enlisted your interest, then does your human personality take up
its task; for as I created and inspired the Idea in your mind, so did
I cause that Idea to fructify therein and give birth to Desire, 
desire to bring into outer manifestation all the possibilities of the
Idea, Desire thus becoming the mortal agent of My Will and supplying
the motive Power; just as the human personality is the mortal
instrument used to confine and focus that Power.</p>

<p>Yes, all ideas and all desires come thus from Me. They are My Ideas
and My Desires which I inspire in your mind and heart in order to
bring them through you into outer manifestation.</p>

<p>You have no ideas of your own and could not possibly have a desire
that came from other than Me, for I AM all there Is. Therefore all
desires are Good, and when thus understood unfailingly come into
speedy and complete fulfillment.</p>

<p>You may wrongly interpret My Desires, My Urges from within, and seek to
use them for your own selfish purpose, but even while permitting this
they still fulfill My Purpose. For it is only by letting you misuse My
Gifts and by the suffering such misuse brings, that I can make you into
the clean and selfless channel I require for the perfect expression of
My Ideas.</p>

<p>We have, then, first the Idea in the mind; then the Desire to bring
the Idea into outer manifestation.</p>

<p>So much for the relation. Now for the process of realization.</p>

<p>In accordance with the definiteness with which the picture of the Idea
is held in the mind, and the extent to which the Idea possesses the
personality, does its creative Power, impelled by Desire, proceed with
Its work. This It does by compelling the mortal mind to think out or to
imagine (image in), or, in other words, to build mental forms into which
I can pour, as into a vacuum, the Impersonal, elemental, vital substance
of the Idea. When the Word is spoken, either silently or audibly,
consciously or unconsciously, this substance at once begins to
materialize Itself, by first directing and controlling the consciousness
and all the activities of both mind and body, and of all minds and all
bodies connected with or related to the Idea, for remember, all
consciousness, and all minds and all bodies are Mine, and are not
separated but are One and wholly Impersonal, and then so attracting,
directing, shaping and molding conditions, things and events that,
sooner or later, the Idea actually comes forth into definite, tangible
manifestation.</p>

<p>So it is that every thing, every condition, every event that ever
transpired, was first an Idea in the mind. It was by desiring, by
thinking, and by speaking forth the Word, that these ideas came into
visible manifestation.</p>

<p>Think this out and prove it for yourself.</p>

<p>This you can do, if you will, by taking any Idea that comes and
following it out through the above process to realization; or by
tracing back any feat you have accomplished, any picture you have
painted, any machine you have invented, or any particular thing or
condition now existing, to the Idea from which it sprang.</p>

<p>This is the plan and process of all true thinking, and therefore of
all Creation.</p>

<p>Listen! You have now and always have had, through this power of
thinking, dominion over all the kingdoms of the Earth. If you but know
it. You have now, this moment, only to Think and SPEAK THE WORD, 
realizing your power, and that I, God, your Omniscient, Omnipresent,
Omnipotent Self, will bring about the results, and the waiting
consciousness of the invisible cells of all matter upon which your
will and attention become focused, which waiting consciousness is
My consciousness, remember, will begin immediately to obey and do
exactly according to the image or plans you have prepared by you
thinking.</p>

<p>For all things are made by the Word, and without the Word was not
anything made that was made.</p>

<p>When you can once realize this and can know that I AM Consciousness
within you is one with the consciousness of all animate and inanimate
matter, and that Its will is one with your will, which is My Will, and
that all your desires are My Desires, then will you begin to know and
feel Me within, and will acknowledge the Power and Glory of My Idea,
which is eternally expressing Itself Impersonally through you.</p>

<p>But it is first wholly necessary that you learn HOW to think, how to
know Your thoughts, those directed by Me, from the thoughts of others;
how to trace thoughts back to their source and to banish undesirable
ones at will from your consciousness; and finally how to control and
utilize your desires so that they will always serve YOU, instead of your
being a slave to them.</p>

<p>You have within you all possibilities. For I AM there. My Idea must
express, and It must express through you. It will express itself
perfectly, if you but let it; if you will only still your human mind,
put aside all personal ideas, beliefs and opinions, and let if flow
forth. All you need to do is to turn within to Me, and let Me direct
your thinking and your desires, let Me express whatever I will, you
personally accepting and doing what I desire you to do. Then will your
desires come true, your life become one grand harmony, your world a
heaven and your self one with My Self.</p>

<p>When you have begun to realize this and have glimpsed somewhat of its
inner meaning, then you will be ready to grasp the real import of what
follows.</p>
