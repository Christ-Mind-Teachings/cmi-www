  <div class="sg2012 transcript ui text container">
  
    <p>Good evening. And welcome to everyone who’s joining us on the
Internet.</p>

<p>I’m going to share something with you—something that
occurred during the first six months of my communion with Paul.</p>

<p>We arrived at a point where it was clear to me that he was conceiving of
our communication as though I were reaching through “the
veil” to talk to him as a human being in the middle of the human
condition where he thought he was. And I had to share with him the good
news which was, that contrary to the picture he had, it was more like
him in a submarine sending up a periscope above the surface of the
water, above the threshold, we’ll say, of the veil and recognizing
me and communing with me where I am, meaning, in a state of
enlightenment, in a state of being Awake, even though I out of all of
Creation, was the only part he was able to recognize and communicate
with.</p>

<p>Now this is very important.</p>

<p>Because if you imagine that when you are doing the two-step and you are
saying, “Father” or “Holy Spirit, what is the truth
here?” and you hear an answer, you are in-filled with the
conscious experience of truth that heals. It is not being provided to
you as an orphan in the orphanage, or as a human being in the middle of
the human condition.  No. It means that in your intent to abandon your
isolation, you have reached through the boundary where you can hear the
Father, or you can hear the Holy Spirit, or you can hear me or your
Guide.</p>

<p>Now this helps explain the difference in a graphical way, in a
conceptual way that expresses the truth, how it is that you are not one
among many, but are the One that constitutes the many. And so that you
might not misconstrue that, let me put it this way: When you do the
two-step and you abandon your isolation and your solid intent to be an
independent agent in your own right, you move your attention into the
experience of Atonement—into the experience of being
Awake—and so your attention is no longer in the human condition as
a human entity.</p>

<p>This is very important.</p>

<p>You are at that point, functioning as the holy Son or Daughter of God
that you truly Are and always have been. When you make that connection,
what happens is that you join with me or the Holy Spirit or the Father
or your Guide—all of which function with the same intent—and
with Us, you can turn around and look back at the situation or
circumstance that caused you to reach out for help and see it from Our
Perspective because that’s where you’re looking at it from.
You see?</p>

<p>Again, the practice of the holy instant puts you in communion with the
Holy Spirit—that which is nothing more than your right
Mind—or me who serves the same function as the Holy Spirit, or the
Father who is always bestowing upon you His Perspective, the Truth of
everything.  And from that place with Us, you are able to turn around,
abandoning or having abandoned the perspective that caused you to reach
out for help in the first place, and look with Us to see the truth.</p>

<p>Now let’s hear these words again. You are not one among many,
which is what the human condition seems to be. You are the One that
constitutes the many. Now you are the One that constitutes the many when
you have engaged in the holy instant, when you have reached out for help
and Help has been given and you are experiencing the Help and in that
experience of Help, you are looking back at what you had called a
problem with God’s Perspective.</p>

<p>Now, is not God the One that constitutes the many? Is not God that which
constitutes all of Creation forever, making it forever new by virtue of
Being the Movement of Creation? That is what God is.</p>

<p>And so God’s Experience is the experience of that. And it is your
Birthright to be experiencing the same thing, because you’ve been
given by the Father, no other capacity. Your function is to experience
what the Father is Being. Your function is to experience the Meanings
and only the Meanings that the Father is Embodying in the Movement of
Creation.</p>

<p>So the experience of Atonement, the experience of Awakening is going to
be one of a shift from the orphanage vantage point, the independent
thinker vantage point, the independent receiver of truth vantage point,
and you’re going to move, I’m going to say for lack of
better words, next to Us and turn around and look at what We’re
looking at, which is just exactly where you were a moment ago in your
distress, but we’re looking at it with the Father’s
Perspective.</p>

<p>So the healing of nations and the healing of individuals is a result of
aligning with willingly, cooperatively, humbly, with the Father’s
Perspective which is your Birthright to be experiencing and looking on
everything from There.</p>

<p>From There you will find no call for justice. You will find no
justification for jealousy or judgment or revenge.</p>

<p>What you want is to be of sound Mind, not fragmented mind. And sound
Mind is the experience of the divine eternal intelligence that God is
Being right where you are as You in your wholeness.</p>

<p>So you see, it’s never a matter of asking from the human
condition, “What is the truth here about the human
condition?” so that you in the human condition can address the
human condition.</p>

<p>Be with that for a moment …</p>

<p>And what will you be? You don’t know. And when you go into the
holy instant not thinking you know what will come of it, you are in a
position to experience divine Vision—divine realization—and
have a new Perspective which is what is called for.</p>

<p>Just keep the visual in mind of you moving to my Side and then turning
around and looking with me at the place where you just came from,
looking at it with my Perspective which is the Father’s
Perspective, which it is your Birthright to be experiencing as your
Perspective. You see?</p>

<p>That’s how you find yourself experiencing Being the One that
constitutes the many because you are experiencing what the Father is
experiencing and in that, being co-creator, as I’ve said before,
the co-operator with the Father. You see? That’s when everything
changes in a twinkling of an eye. And the twinkling of an eye in which
everything can change can happen now … or by December 21st. You
see?</p>

<p>It’s time and it’s not as complicated as you would make it.</p>

<p>Now most of you who are listening have had the experience of revelation
or divine insight—divine communion with a divine Source—that
has changed you. And you did not realize that when you had that
experience, you weren’t having it from the human condition on a
planet that is part of a physical universe that come from a “Big
Bang” and had nothing to do with a divine Source. You have had the
experience of seeing from the Father’s Vantage Point. You have had
a moment of illumination in which your divinity was being directly
experienced, not successfully blocked by your intent to be a successful
independent agent. That is what happened! It was you having an
experience of your divinity. It was you Being the One that constituted
the many because you were willing to look through the Eyes of that One
that does constitute the many and you were not choosing to have a
separate interpretation of it all, yourself.</p>

<p>Now let’s go into the book:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The fierce attraction which guilt holds for fear is wholly absent from
love’s gentle perception.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p>It’s the difference between the orphanage perspective—of you
being one amongst many—and the Father’s Perspective, the
Perspective of the Holy Spirit, in which you are the One that
constitutes the many inseparable from the whole.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>What love would look upon is meaningless to fear…</p>
</div>

<p>… you see?</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… and quite invisible.</p>
</div>

<p>But if you stop and think about it, when you reach out in the holy
instant to ask for Help, you’re asking for the Help to look upon
the meaningless and help you do something about it. And that’s not
the answer because it doesn’t allow for your perspective changing
so that you are seeing it from a place that Knows the answer which
doesn’t call for the practice of force or powerful correction but
allows your heart to melt so that Love flows and Love is received, and
there is a gentleness of your spirit that was not present when you were
in the state of reaction that caused you to be uncomfortable and ask for
Help—engage in the holy instant.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Relationships in this world are the result of how the world is seen.</p>
</div>

<p>And I’m going to say, where it is seen from.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>And this depends on which emotion was called on to send its messengers
to look upon it, and return with word of what they saw. Fear’s
messengers are trained through terror, and they tremble when their
master calls upon them to serve him.</p>
</div>

<p>Now this sounds really ugly. Especially if you’re the one in the
middle of distress who is sending out messengers of fear to find proof
that fear is called for, that fear is justified and that force can be
appropriately brought to bear upon the situation. But indeed, when it
comes right down to it and you’re between a rock and a hard place,
and your world seems to aggressively demand that you do something to
protect yourself, you do indeed succumb to fear and you do indeed send
out messengers of fear and that is when you find out how capable you
seem to be to be a master of the messengers of fear who trained them
through terror so that they tremble when you call upon them to serve
you.</p>

<p>You can be pretty ugly when you are between a rock and a hard place. If
things are relatively smooth and calm in your life, these things never
surface and you say, “Well, I’m far from an agent of a
horror movie, I’m far from that which promotes evil,” but
the fact is that …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Fear’s messengers …</p>
</div>

<p>… your fear’s messengers …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… are trained through terror, and they tremble when their master
calls upon them to serve him. For fear is merciless even to its friends.
Its messengers …</p>
</div>

<p>… the ones you send out for confirmation that there is
justification for attack …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… steal guiltily away in hungry search of guilt, for they are
kept cold and starving, and made very vicious by their master, who
allows them to feast only upon what they return to him.</p>
</div>

<p>Mind you, this is talking about each one of you who, while still in the
orphanage, engage in this kind of a context of being. Fortunately, the
correction is simple. And fortunately, you cannot actually accomplish
becoming what you are not. And so there is no penalty awaiting for you.
There is just the suffering that you will be relieved of when you
abandon your independence and reach “through the veil” to
join with your Guide or the Holy Spirit or the Father humbly and with
commitment.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>No little shred of guilt escapes their hungry eyes.</p>
</div>

<p>… the messengers you send out …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>And in their savage search for sin, they pounce on any living thing they
see…</p>
</div>

<p>… you see? [chuckle] There’s not any real discrimination.
They pounce on anything, guilty or not. They pounce on any aspect of the
Kingdom of Heaven … …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>and carry it screaming to their master…</p>
</div>

<p>… you …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… to be devoured.</p>
</div>

<p>This is one of the reasons it is so important to engage in the holy
instant. So that you do not ignorantly or with great purpose, indict and
punish your fellowman or yourself or your body by sending out messengers
looking for that which is awful and then believing the confirming news
that they return to you, so that you end up condemning a Brother or a
nation or a race or a situation that needs the healing unction of Love
and not the presence of the justification of hate and fear to penalize
it.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Send not these savage messengers into the world, to feast upon it, and
to prey upon reality.</p>
</div>

<p>You hear that?</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… and to prey upon reality.</p>
</div>

<p>To prey upon the Kingdom of Heaven that it all is. To prey upon the Sons
and Daughters of God who they Are—the real actuality of the
Presence of God manifest.</p>

<p>I’ve said it before, there’s only one thing confronting you:
Seeing either truly or through a glass darkly. And that one thing is
Reality.  That one thing is God’s Creation. That one thing is the
Movement of Creation occurring now… now … now … now
… now.  If you’re seeing something different, don’t
believe it. Don’t use what you’re seeing as the basis for
any action other than saying, “Father what is the truth
here?” and then be quiet enough to hear the Father or me or the
Holy Spirit so that you might, now that you’re consciously with
Us, turn around so that you can look at everything from where
We’re standing, where We’re Being so that you might
experience being the One that constitutes the many. The One that is
inseparable from your Brothers and Sisters and all of Creation in its
perfection—it’s fullness.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Send not these savage messengers into the world, to feast upon it, and
to prey upon reality. For they will bring you word of bones and skin and
flesh.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, very simply what that means is: That when you are identifying as
one among many, when you are one diligent independent agent trying to
make yourself valid as an independent agent, you will find that you are
identifying yourself as a body engaged in these activities:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… bones and skin and flesh.</p>
</div>

<p>Not only that, bones and skin and flesh that can be injured, decay and
die—in other words, that which is mortal. That is the absurd and
destructive perception of God’s Creation: The manifestation of the
Movement of God which is incapable of sin, disease or death, which is as
eternal as the visibility and tangibility of all of the rest of
Creation. But they will bring you the messengers you send out, the
messengers of fear…</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… they will bring you word of bones and skin and flesh.</p>
</div>

<p>And of course, it’ll be talking about your Brothers and Sisters.
But it confirms to you that what’s true of them is true of you,
which is of course, why you sent the messengers out in the first place.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>They have been taught to seek for the corruptible, and to return with
gorges filled with things decayed and rotted.</p>
</div>

<p>In other words, misperceived so badly, distorted so far out of the scope
of Reality and of God’s Creation that they present nothing
Godlike, nothing divine, nothing perfect, nothing loveable.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>To them such things are beautiful …</p>
</div>

<p>… why?</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… because they seem to allay their savage pangs of hunger.</p>
</div>

<p>They get to bring them home to their master and then they get to feed on
them. And so they appreciate them because for a little while they feel
full, they feel satisfied, justice has been served, purpose has been
fulfilled, correction has been done. But there hasn’t been a bit
of healing.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>For they are frantic with the pain of fear, and would avert the
punishment of him who sends them forth by offering him what they hold
dear.</p>
</div>

<p>That, no matter how well covered up, is the modus operandi of
functioning as an orphan in a material world and universe where God is
not seen.</p>

<p>But, continuing:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The Holy Spirit …</p>
</div>

<p>… umm, that which you have experienced as a result of being
humble and engaging in the holy instant …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The Holy Spirit has given you love’s messengers to send instead of those
you trained through fear. They …</p>
</div>

<p>… Love’s messengers …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… are as eager to return to you what they hold dear as are the
others …</p>
</div>

<p>… the messengers for fear.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>If you send them …</p>
</div>

<p>… Love’s messengers …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… forth, they will see only the blameless and the beautiful, the
gentle and the kind. They will be as careful to let no little act of
charity, no tiny expression of forgiveness, no little breathe of love
escape their notice. And they will return with all the happy things they
found, to share them lovingly with you. Be not afraid of THEM. They
offer you salvation. Theirs are the messages of safety, for they see the
world as kind.</p>
</div>

<p>Okay … that paragraph sounds a little Polly Anna, doesn’t
it? Oh, sort of like the practice of positive thinking, overlooking what
needs to be looked at, right? Pretending it’s not there, right?
Well, that’s what the orphan thinks, that’s what the
independent agent thinks.  Because the independent agent believes that
he will succeed at becoming real as a result of dealing with and
overcoming all of the evil, all the things that the messengers for fear
have brought back to confirm that there is danger and that he needs or
she needs to protect himself or herself. You see?</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>If you send forth only the messengers the Holy Spirit gives you,</p>
</div>

<p>… which of course, takes trust because it’s not been your
habit.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>If you send forth only the messengers the Holy Spirit gives you,
WANTING no messages but theirs, you will see fear no more.</p>
</div>

<p>And the ego says, “Right!” And you will be more vulnerable
than you’ve ever been before, because you’re ignoring the
facts, you’re ignoring the reality that this is a world of
conflict, this is a polarized world in which the positive and the
negative are in constant content … constant conflict with each
other, constant contest with each other so that there is a constant
state of tension and misery.</p>

<p>And so you must face this suggestion and act contrary to it if
you’re going to reach out to the Holy Spirit and if you’re
going to benefit from the clarity of His teaching, the clarity which He
will reveal to you about what is true and what is real and what is not,
and what you no longer need to engage in.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The world will be transformed before your sight, cleansed of all guilt
and softly brushed with beauty.</p>
</div>

<p>Now here’s the key:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The world contains no fear which you laid not upon it.</p>
</div>

<p>As an orphan you’re convinced that there is a world “out
there” that has fearful things in it on its own, in its own right
and you’re the innocent victim of it. It’s not true! But you
will not find that it’s not true until you engage in the holy
instant and follow through and want no messages but the ones that
Love’s messengers bring back to you.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The world contains no fear which you laid not upon it. And none you
cannot ask love’s messengers to remove from it, and see it still.</p>
</div>

<p>If you ask Love’s messengers to remove it, you will no longer be
able to see it. Is that like an Ostrich sticking its head in the sand?
No it’s not! It’s like you sticking your periscope up into
the Father’s Perspective and seeing the truth in which fear is not
present and the results of fear are not present.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>The Holy Spirit has given you His messengers to send to each
other…</p>
</div>

<p>… your Brothers and Sisters and every part of Creation …</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… and return to each with what love sees. They have been given to
replace the hungry dogs of fear you sent instead. And they go forth to
signify the END of fear.</p>
</div>

<p>Now this may all sound very impractical. Because you look out on a world
and the very air-waves are full of pronouncements of threat and
conspiracy and planned hatred and plots to undermine the peace of
mankind, and it all seems to be very real and something that something
must be done about.</p>

<p>But I’ve got to tell you something for perspective: You see a
world full of microbes, germs, things that transmit disease, tendencies
for bodies to be flawed and suddenly be sent into a tailspin of
degeneration. You take medication to protect yourself against this virus
or that germ because, not the air-waves, but the very air seems to be
laden with danger.</p>

<p>Well, I will tell you something: There are people all around this globe
who consciously and consistently engage in healing. And they do it by
not paying attention to the messengers that would come back that say,
“Oh, this body is terminally ill, this organ is actually being
eaten away by this, that or the other thing.” These people
engaging in healing do not govern themselves according to the messengers
which come and claim that there is uncorrectable disease, uncorrectable
damage.</p>

<p>This is important.</p>

<p>They insist upon, in there way, practicing the two-step and saying,
“Father, what is the truth here? Father, I know that what is
presenting itself, the messengers that are coming to me are not telling
me the God’s honest truth. They are lying! No matter what x-ray
shows what’s happening, no matter how much physical evidence there
is to it, I know that it is not Your Will, therefore, I am not going to
trust these messengers. I am not going to attempt to cope with this as
an independent agent, as one among many. But I choose to join with You
Father, and listen for Your Voice, to have You reveal to me the truth
that proves the lie to be a lie, to prove that the messengers are not
legitimate or believable. And I’m going to stay with my connection
with You until I see the evidence.”</p>

<p>And the key is: That healings occur every day of every sort, from the
eradication of terminal illness, to a festered sliver coming out
spontaneously from a finger that it was embedded in.</p>

<p>Being the One that constitutes the many, means that there are no
messages…</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>… words of bones and skin and flesh …</p>
</div>

<p>… because in the holy instant is where the Father’s laws
prevail, where the laws of Creation prevail.</p>

<p>And so when those who practice healing everyday on this globe and
experience the healings, they are demonstrating the fact that not anyone
needs to believe the messengers of fear that they have sent out and that
have come back and disturbed things. And without engaging in conflict,
but engaging in joining with the Father or the Holy Spirit or me and
turning around and looking at the situation with Us, they find NOTHING
THERE. In other words, they discover what could be called spontaneous
healing, even instantaneous healing. You see?</p>

<p>You listen to the news and you don’t join while you’re
listening, and you come to the conclusion that: “Man, you gotta go
out and get those bastards. Do somethin to ‘em!  Make ‘em
hurt until  they  stop!” Keep  your  attention on what the
messengers for fear have returned to you—the negative
interpretations, even the apparent behaviors of people, which like an
organ being consumed by cancer seems to state is something real to be
forced out of the situation, forced out of the world. No. Stop it!</p>

<p>When you hear these things and you’re inclined to believe them and
get revved up about it, riled up about it, so that you send out even
more messengers of fear looking for further confirmation of how
dangerous things are so that you might bring more force into play in
changing something, which if you practice the holy instant, will become
obvious to you is an illusion, no matter how real it seems to be.</p>

<p>Again, I must return to this: Diseases are healed every day, not by
forcing a body, not by forcing a physical process to change, but by
abandoning the perspective from the orphanage, joining with the Holy
Spirit or the Father or me or your Guide where We are, and turning
around and looking at what prompted you to join Us from Our vantage
point.</p>

<p>Healing occurs and it’s miraculous because force is never
involved.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>If you send forth only the messengers the Holy Spirit gives you, WANTING
no messages but theirs, you will see fear no more.</p>
</div>

<p>You will see no cancer consumed organ. And the x-rays will say there is
perfection here. Because there is a God and there is Creation, and the
Creation is as perfect as the singularity of the Father, which disallows
for polarization, conflict. This is the truth.</p>

<p>Again, it happens as a result of your coming to where We are and turning
around and looking with Us at the place you came from, so that you might
see it with Our Perspective, with your true Perspective, free of
delusions.</p>

<p>Then you could say:</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>Love, too, would set a feast before you, on a table covered with a
spotless cloth, set in a quiet garden where no sound but singing and a
softly joyous whispering is ever heard.</p>
</div>

<p>“Oh, yeah, this is too good to be true, this is fantasy.”
Embrace it as the truth, else you will stand in denial of it and
distance yourself from its experience.</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>This is a feast which honors your holy relationship, and at which
everyone is welcomed as an honored guest.</p>
</div>

<p>Even the ones whom before you practiced the holy instant, seemed to be
the justification for your suffering, that it would have seemed could
receive no relief without the bringing of force to bear upon the
“bastard” or “bastards.”</p>

<div class="well book">
  <p>And in a holy instant grace is said by everyone together, as they join
in gentleness before the table of communion. And I will join you there,
as long ago I promised and promise still. For in your new relationship
am I made welcome. And where I am made welcome, there I AM.</p>
</div>

<p>Where I am welcome, there is the Holy Spirit. Where I am welcome, there
is the Father. And where I am welcome, there is You.  And where I am and
where You are, there is no “bastard” to be dealt with.</p>

<p>The belief is that cancer—most forms of cancer—are terminal.
There are beliefs that other forms of disease are terminal, but healing
of them is occurring everyday through the shift, in one form or another,
from being one amongst the many to being the one that constitutes the
many because you have let the One that constitutes the many be your
Mind. And you are willing to look at everything from the vantage point
of that Mind which is the One that constitutes the many—meaning
God. And in that act you come into the full conscious experience of
your, capital “S” Self. That’s what this is all
about.</p>

<p>I love you all. And I look forward to being with you next time.</p>
