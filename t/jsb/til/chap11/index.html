  <div class="til transcript ui text container">
  
    <p>In the Garden of Eden, where you abode before entering upon your
Earthly mission, there grew this tree whose fruit is called the
Knowledge of Good and Evil.</p>

<p>While dwelling in the Garden you were still wholly Impersonal, for you
had not yet tasted of this fruit. Having once yielded to Desire, the
Earthly agent of My Will, whose main work is to make you eat this fruit,
the moment you had eaten, that moment you descended, or fell, or were
forced from your Edenic estate (like the chick from the shell or the
rose from the bud), and you found yourself involved in conditions
altogether new and strange. For now, instead of having dominion over the
lower kingdoms, and of their supplying your every want, you had to till
the ground to get it to bring forth fruit, and by the sweat of your brow
had you to earn your bread.</p>

<p>Having taken upon yourself this Earthly mission, it now became
necessary for you to enter fully into all conditions of Earth life, in
order to develop a mind and perfect a body capable of expressing
perfectly My Idea on Earth, the real cause and reason of your
entering into this Dream condition.</p>

<p>So having fallen or stepped out of your Impersonal or Edenic estate,
you yielded completely to the lure of this Dream World, and now
permitting Desire wholly to lead, you no longer were capable of seeing
the Reality or Soul of things; for you had put on a physical body, an
Earthly covering with a human brain, which acted as a veil to your
Soul Consciousness, and so bedimmed your sight and clouded your mind
that the light of Truth did not penetrate through, and everything was
falsely colored and distorted by your human understanding.</p>

<p>In this Dream condition you saw all things darkly, as through a mist,
and with this mist enshrouding everything you could not see things in
their Reality, but only their misty appearance, which now however
seemed to you the real things themselves.</p>

<p>This was so with everything you saw through your Dream eyes, with
things both animate and inanimate, with everything you conceived in
your human mind, with even your own Self and your other Selves round
about you.</p>

<p>Thus no longer seeing the Soul of things, but only their misty
shadows, you grew to thinking these shadows were real substance, and
that the world about you was composed of and filled with such
substance.</p>

<p>This mist was only the effect of the Light of Truth being invisible to
your human mind, whose intellect, like an imperfect lens, only befogged
and twisted everything and made it appear as Real, keeping your
consciousness continually busied with these myriad illusions of your
Dream World.</p>

<p>Now the intellect is a creature of and wholly controlled by Desire, and
is not, as many suppose, a faculty of the Soul. In other words, this
mist then was the clouded lens of your human intellect, which, because
controlled by Desire, falsely portrayed and interpreted to your
consciousness every image, idea and impulse I inspired from within or
attracted from without, during the process of My awakening your
consciousness to a recognition of My Idea within ever urging for outer
expression.</p>

<p>All this I did purposely, however, through the agency of Desire, in
order to lead you consciously into the heart of Earth conditions.</p>

<p>While this false vision, inspired by Desire, caused many mis-steps and
much trouble and suffering, and you gradually lost confidence in your
Self – in Me, the Impersonal One within, in fact, you forgot Me,
so that you did not know where to turn in your helplessness; yet it
was only through your thus losing the memory of your Divine estate,
and centering all your consciousness in these Earthly conditions, that
I could develop your human mind and will, and all your faculties, and
provide your human body with the strength and powers that would enable
Me to give perfect expression to My Divine Idea on Earth, which
eventually must BE.</p>

<p>So, through your mistakes and troubles and sufferings, Desire for relief
caused the Idea of Evil to spring up in your mind, and likewise when
these troubles were not It inspired the Idea of Good.</p>

<p>To all appearances of things and conditions you attributed these
qualities of Good or Evil, according to whether or not they
satisfied Desire My Agent, in Reality My human Self, or You, in your
human personality.</p>

<p>All these conditions and experiences in life which you entered into, and
which when pleasing seemed Good, and when displeasing seemed Evil, were
merely incidents created by Desire to quicken in you certain Soul
faculties, which would enable you to recognize the Truths that I, within
wished at the time to impress upon your consciousness. The apparent Evil
was the negative aspect of the Fruit of the Tree, which always lured you
on by its fair appearance and by the sweetness of the first taste to eat
and enjoy to satiation, or until its harmful effects manifested and
became a curse, bringing final disillusionment; which served to turn or
force you back in humiliation to Me, your True Self, Who, through the
new consciousness thus aroused, was then enabled to extract the Essence
of the Fruit and incorporate it into Soul substance and tissue.</p>

<p>Likewise the apparent Good was the positive aspect of the Fruit,
which, having pushed forth of itself into expression, through your
recognition of and obedience to its urge, was now permitting you to
enjoy its happy and natural effects, and to receive the outward
benefits of My loving inspiration and guidance.</p>

<p>This you, who was being led by Desire through all these experiences, was
only your human personality, which the Real you was training and
developing and preparing so it could become a perfect instrument for
Your use in the expression of My Idea, ever seeking to manifest Its
perfection in the flesh.</p>

<p>All this You did, not only compelling your human personality to eat but
to live on the fruit of the so-called Tree of Knowledge of Good and
Evil, until you had seen and known all the so-called Evil, and from
living on and with it had discovered in it the germ of so-called Good,
plucked it, lifted it up, and turned it right-side out; so that you from
that time on knew that Good and Evil had no real existence, and were but
relative terms descriptive of outside conditions looked at from
different viewpoints, or were only different outer aspects of a central
inner Truth, the Reality of which was what You sought to Know, Be and
Express.</p>

<p>During the latter ages you have been, as it were, gradually throwing
off layer after layer of human consciousness, dissipating the mist or
glamour thrown around your mind by the intellect; subduing,
controlling, spiritualizing, and thus clarifying the intellect itself;
until now you are beginning to awaken and to see, through the ever
thinning remaining layers, occasional glimpses of Me, the one Great
Reality, within all things.</p>

<p>All this time, You, the omniscient, Impersonal I AM of You, were
consciously and intentionally doing all this; not for the purpose of
getting the mere knowledge of Earth conditions and things, as your
Intellect has so loudly and authoritatively proclaimed, but in order
that you might harvest what You had sown in the dim ages past, and
could manifest My Perfect Idea on Earth, even as You are now
manifesting It in the Impersonal estate, Your Heavenly Home.</p>

<p>You, remember, are the Great Impersonal I, Who AM doing all this, Who
AM continually changing in outward appearance, but Who within AM
eternally the same.</p>

<p>The endless flow of the Seasons, the Spring, with its busy sowing;
the Summer, with its warm, restful ripening; the Autumn, with its
bounteous harvesting; the Winter, with its cool, peaceful plenty, year
after year, life after life, century after century, age after age -
are only the outbreathing of My Idea as I inspire It forth through the
Earth and through You, My Attribute, and through all My other
Attributes, during the process of unfolding in outer manifest state
the perfection of My Nature.</p>

<p>Yes, I am doing it through You, because You are an expression of Me,
because only through You, My Attribute, can I express My Self, can I
BE. I AM expressing My SELF.</p>

<p>I AM in You as the oak is in the acorn. You are I as the sunbeam is
the Sun. You are a phase of Me in expression. You, one of My Divine
Attributes, are eternally trying to express My perfection through Your
mortal personality.</p>

<p>Just as an artist sees in his mind the perfect picture he wants to
paint, but his hand cannot quite portray with the crude mediums of brush
and color the true quality and effect he sees, so do You see Me within
Your Self and know We are One, but always are prevented, by the
imperfection of the Earthly material of your human personality, with its
animal body, its mortal mind, and selfish intellect, from perfectly
expressing Me.</p>

<p>Yet, I created your body, mind and intellect, in order to express My
Self through you. The body I made in the Image of My Perfection; the
mind I gave to inform you of Me and My works; the intellect I gave to
interpret My Idea as I inspired it to the mind. But you have been so
distracted by the human phases of this body, mind and intellect, and
their outer uses, that you have forgotten Me, the One and Only Reality
within, Whose Divine nature I AM ever seeking to express to and through
you.</p>

<p>The time is soon here when the outward uses shall no longer distract,
and My Reality shall be revealed unto you in all the glory of Its
perfection within You.</p>

<p>You, when I thus reveal My Self, shall not be more blessed than
before, unless that which I have revealed shall become the Bread of
Life to you, and you shall live and manifest the Life It reveals.</p>
