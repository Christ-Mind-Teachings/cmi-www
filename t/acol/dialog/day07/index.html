    <p>7.1 What does the idea of only now coming to acceptance imply but that
you were previously unaccepting? And what does being unaccepting imply
but the very denial of yourself that you have come to see as your former
state?</p>

<p>7.2 Denial of yourself was the precondition that set the stage for the
time of learning. The time of learning would not have been needed had
you not denied your Self. When you saw yourself as separate and alone,
you could not help but suffer fear, loneliness, and all the ills that
came from the base emotion of fear. Fear is degenerating. Nothing about
fear is life giving. You thus were given life only to have it become
degenerated by fear.</p>

<p>7.3 Acceptance of your Self is the precondition for the time of
acceptance. You are no longer denying your Self. You are no longer
denying unity. You have replaced fear with love. Love is life giving and
life supporting. There is thus nothing now degenerating about life.</p>

<p>7.4 Life is now supported. Support is thus a condition of the time of
acceptance.</p>

<p>7.5 You must realize here that the pattern of learning is now all that
is left that can be degenerating to you. While you always were
supported, the idea of learning that you accepted during the time of
learning was not one of support but one of effort. You must accept, now,
that the pattern of learning is an extension of fear and be willing and
vigilant in replacing it with a pattern of acceptance. I say this
because so many of you still do not feel supported in your daily life.
You may feel supported in your spiritual life, in your progress toward
full awareness and the elevation of the self of form, but as in the
discussion of abundance, you may still feel unsupported in form. Realize
now, that this makes no sense when our goal is the elevation of form. If
for no other reason, begin to accept this support of form because it
makes sense. It is logical. And realize further that love is not opposed
to logic but returns true reason to the mind and heart.</p>

<p>7.6 Love replaces fear and is life-generating rather than
life-degenerating. Your bodies will thus regenerate rather than
degenerate. Love is, of course, not a condition, as it is not an
attribute, but the effect of living from love rather than from fear will
have a major transformative effect on form in this time of acceptance.
Regeneration is a condition of the time of acceptance.</p>

<p>7.7 Another condition of the time of acceptance that will be of great
service to you now is that of the different relationship that you will
have with time. This is a time of convergence, intersection, and
pass-through of the finite and the infinite, of time and no time. Time
has not yet ceased to be, but as you are in a state of transformation,
so too is it. Again I remind you, as within, so without. As you let go
of time’s hold on you, it will let go of you. Time will seem to expand
but will actually be contracting into nothingness. Time is replaced by
presence, by your ability to exist in the here and now in acceptance and
without fear.</p>

<p>7.8 Again let me remind you that you are in an in-between time. Thus
these conditions I have spoken of and those I have yet to speak of, are
also in an in-between state. They exist along with the new you. They
exist in acceptance and union. They do not exist in learning and
separation. They exist in love. They do not exist in fear. As with
Christ-consciousness, you are moving from a place of maintenance of
these conditions to one of sustainability of these conditions. They do
not come about from changes in your external circumstances but from
changes in your internal perspective.</p>

<p>7.9 The conditions that affect life are conditions that affect the body.
Yet it was only your mind’s acceptance of the condition of fear that led
the body to exhibit the conditions of fear in the time of learning. Thus
it is the mind’s acceptance of love that will lead the body to exhibit
the effects of love in the time of acceptance.</p>

<p>7.10 A further condition of the time of acceptance is that of expansion.
The singular self you once believed yourself to be was not capable of
true expansion and true sharing. The singular self withdrew into its own
little world and created its own universe. The elevated Self of form
will expand into the world and create a new universe. This condition of
expansion is operative now and beginning to find manifestation through
the sharing we are doing here.</p>

<p>7.11 Conditions of the time of acceptance are conditions of creation and
include those we have already spoken of as movement, being, and
expression; and convergence, intersection and pass-through.</p>

<p>7.12 There are many lesser conditions that are nonetheless extremely
transformative, such as the replacement of special relationship with the
devotion of holy relationship that we have already spoken of. Another
replacement is that of control with grace. This occurs as you give up
the control you have but thought you exerted over your life and its
circumstances, and live in a state of grace, meeting grace with grace by
accepting what is given for your regeneration.</p>

<p>7.13 It is easy to see from here how the dominoes fall and each
condition of learning is replaced, always by a far gentler and more
compassionate alternative. Thus there is no need for me to list every
new condition here. As you become increasingly aware of your
relationship with union, each of these new conditions and your
relationship with each of these new conditions will become clear to you.</p>

<p>7.14 Obviously your relationship or access to union is of supreme
importance, since all else will come of this. However, this is not an
“if this, then that” situation even if it may seem so. Is the process of
breathing an “if this, then that” situation, just because breathing
sustains life? Your access to union sustains real life, the life of the
Self, and will come to sustain the elevated Self of form in a way as
natural to you as breathing.</p>

<p>7.15 Access to unity is a phrase that will only be used in this
in-between time. You have always existed in unity and once this is fully
realized you will no more need access to unity than you need access to
breathing. Unity will be your natural state.</p>

<p>7.16 When your natural state is fully returned to you and sustained
within Christ-consciousness, the conditions of the time of acceptance,
like the conditions of the time of learning, will pass. There are no
conditions in the state of union as there are no attributes to love. The
natural created Self is all that is. Reverence prevails.</p>

<p>7.17 There will be, however, a new stage following the time of
acceptance in which the elevated Self of form will be created and come
into full manifestation.</p>

<p>7.18 And yet what we are concerned about now is the present. It is here,
in this present and given time on the mountain that you must realize
that the conditions of the time of acceptance, like the conditions of
the time of learning, arise from within. Life has always existed within
the conditions of the time of acceptance. The conditions of the time of
learning were but imposed conditions that also arose from within.</p>

<p>7.19 The conditions of the time of acceptance that we have spoken of are
thus not new conditions. They are conditions natural to your Self, to a
mind and heart joined in union. It was the disjoining of mind and heart,
of the real Self from the ego-self, that created the need for learning
and the imposition, from within, of the conditions of the time of
learning.</p>

<p>7.20 The condition of the time of acceptance that will most clearly
reveal to you your status in regard to maintaining or sustaining your
access to union will be that of the replacement of doubt with certainty.
Certainty is a condition of the present. Realize you may say you are
certain of the future or the past but that you cannot make it so. Thus
your ability to maintain and then sustain your access to union and thus
your certainty, goes hand-in-hand with your ability to live in the
present. This ability is also contingent upon your recognition of what
certainty really is.</p>

<p>7.21 There is an acceptance of the present that some of you are finding
difficult and a false sense of certainty that some of you may be
experiencing. Thus these will be the subject of our next dialogue.</p>
