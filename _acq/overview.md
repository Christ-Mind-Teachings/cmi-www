## Overview of Teachings
{: .disable-paragraph-marker}

The diagram illustrates how the library is organized. There are four different teachings represented by vertical columns containing a box for each component. Notice the columns headed with "acim", "raj", "wom", and "jsb". Columns containing <i class="search icon"></i> icon indicate teachings that are fully indexed and searchable. See the [CMI Search](/acq/search/) section for information about search.

Boxes headed by a <i class="volume up icon"></i> symbol indicate teachings with integrated audio. See the [CMI Audio](/acq/audio/) section of *Get Acquainted* for information about the audio player and other features.

<div class="ui container" markdown="1">
  ![Library Orgainization](/public/img/cmi/cmi-contents.jpg)
</div>

The number in parenthesis, for example (29), indicate the number of chapters or lessons or questions that that teaching component contains.

The first box under each teaching is labeled *Get Acquainted* and contains one or more pages of pertainate information about the teaching. Please note help and information about the Library itself is found in the *Get Acquainted* box with the red border in the diagram. 

## A More Technical Note

The library uses the *christmind.info* domain. When you specify the *www* subdomain, which is the default, the Library main page or card catalog is displayed. That url is *https://www.christmind.info*.

As indicated in the diagram, each teaching is found under a unique subdomain;

<div class="ui bulleted list">
  <a class="item" href="https://acim.christmind.info">acim [https://acim.christmind.info]</a>
  <a class="item" href="https://raj.christmind.info">raj [https://raj.christmind.info]</a>
  <a class="item" href="https://wom.christmind.info">wom [https://wom.christmind.info]</a>
  <a class="item" href="https://jsb.christmind.info">jsb [https://jsb.christmind.info]</a>
</div>
