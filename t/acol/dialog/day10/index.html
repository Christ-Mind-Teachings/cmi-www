    <p>10.1 Power is the ability to be cause and effect. It is the ability to
harness the cause and effect power of love. It is a quality of form as
well as a quality of union. Form is the ultimate expression of the power
of creation. The power of creation, harnessed by form in the service of
form is the next step in the expansion of the power of creation. It is
the power of the elevated Self of form.</p>

<p>10.2 See you now why the certainty of union must be combined with the
confidence of the self of form? Certainty is knowing that this power
exists.  Confidence is the expression of your reliance upon it. To rely
on your own power is to rely on the connection that exists between the
self of form and the Self of union and to, through this reliance, tie
the two together so that there is no seam, no boundary, no remaining
separation.</p>

<p>10.3 We have talked before of conviction and your willingness to, like
the apostles, let your conviction spring from your willingness to
experience its cause and its effect. I am asking you now to be willing
to move from conviction to reliance. I am not asking you to do this
today any more than I am asking you to move from maintenance to
sustainability today, I am merely making you aware of this difference,
just as I made you aware of the difference between the states of
maintenance and sustainability. As with the states of maintenance and
sustainability, I am giving you cause for movement, the effect of which
will be the movement from conviction to reliance.</p>

<p>10.4 Conviction is tied to belief, and to a former lack of belief that
has been overcome. Reliance is not tied to belief nor to the overcoming
of disbelief and thus releases you from the need for belief. Certainty
is complete lack of doubt and any perceived need for doubt.</p>

<p>10.5 Realize that in the time of learning, you felt a need for your
doubt just as you felt a need for your beliefs and for the reassurances
that were important to your self-confidence. These needs are tied to
your feelings and thus we will return to a discussion of feelings in
connection with the ideas of confidence, reliance, and certainty.</p>

<p>10.6 Confidence in your feelings will lead to confidence in your Self.
While you think it is your access to unity that will be the more
difficult to achieve and sustain, this will not be the case for most of
you, for the simple reason that the certainty that comes from union will
seem to come, at least initially, from a place other than the self.
Because certainty seems to come from a place “other than” or beyond the
self of form, you will instinctively have greater trust in it. You will
believe it comes from a place “other than” or beyond the self of form
because it comes in the form of certainty.</p>

<p>10.7 The feelings that lead you to either a state of confidence or to a
state of lack of confidence could be spoken of most succinctly by
considering your concept of intuition. You all understand intuition and
each of you have had intuitive moments. You may have felt, for no good
reason, as if you shouldn’t do something you were about to do. You may
have trusted the intuition and then learned that had you done what you
planned to do, an accident or some other event you would not have
welcomed might have occurred. You may have never had any proof that
following your intuition was the correct thing to do but still felt as
if it was. Or you may have doubted your intuition and had something
occur that made you think back and wish that you had not doubted it.</p>

<p>10.8 This intuition came as a feeling, but not necessarily as a feeling
of certainty. You may have reacted to the intuition with confidence or
with lack of confidence.</p>

<p>10.9 There are other instances of intuition that come, not as these
seeming warnings, but as what you might call intuitive flashes of
insight—intuition that causes you to make connections between point A
and point B, be point A and point B distinct points in a scientific
puzzle or murky points about relationships between lovers.</p>

<p>10.10 This type of intuition seems to come more as thought than as
feeling, but even so, it is your feelings about such thoughts that will
often determine how you act upon them. Do you trust in your intuition or
do you doubt it?</p>

<p>10.11 What you have trusted in the most is rational thought, and
intuition is different than rational thought, as are feelings of all
kinds. You think of feelings either as that which comes to you through
your five senses or as emotions, and you have not trusted in these
feelings as much as you have trusted in rational thought. This lack of
trust works both for you and against you now. It works for you in that
you do not have to resist and reject an existing trust as you do with
the thoughts of the mind you call rational. It works against you because
all feelings are capable of providing what you have called intuitive
knowledge or insights and your distrust of this knowledge and insight
will need to be overcome.</p>

<p>10.12 Feelings come from the innate knowing of the self of form—in
short, from the body. The body is the “given” form and while it was the
perfect vehicle for learning in the time of learning, it is now being
transformed into the perfect vehicle for the realization of the elevated
Self of form. During this transformation, we work with what is as well
as with the new and the forgotten. This is why it has been said that the
certainty that comes from access to unity may be less difficult for you
to become aware of and accept than the confidence in the self of form
that must accompany it. In developing the confidence of the self of
form, we work with what has been in a new way, and as you all know from
the time of learning, it is often more difficult to become adept in
doing something in a way different than you have done it before than to
do something completely new. This is because old patterns or habits must
be done away with before achievement of a new way is possible.</p>

<p>10.13 This also relates to our discussion of image versus presence and
to the image of your personal self that was discussed at the beginning
of our dialogue. While you still hold an image of your personal self,
you still hold inaccurate ideas about the feelings of the personal self.
This is because your image of the personal self is based on the past and
the feelings of the past.  This is also because your image of the
personal self is a mental construct, and not a simple mental construct
but a whole set of thoughts, beliefs, and mental pictures.</p>

<p>10.14 Because you believe that your feelings have misled you in the
past, you now still doubt your feelings. Because you have doubted
yourself in the past, you now still look for reassurances and proof that
you are “right” before you feel confidence and the ability to act. To
“know” before you act is wise. But to think that doubting your feelings
or seeking outside assurances of what you know will lead to either
confidence or certainty is foolish.</p>

<p>10.15 Pause a moment here and consider our need for a distinction
between the certainty you feel from unity and the confidence you need to
feel in the self of form. Reflect further on your idea of certainty
coming from a place “other than” the self. Realize in these reflections
that you are still reliant on means “other than” the self, including
your image of the state of unity and including your image of me.
Although you have been called to union you still hold an image of the
state of unity as separate from yourself. Although I have removed myself
from the role of teacher and entered this dialogue with you as an equal,
you still hold an image of me as “other than” yourself. You will never
fully rely upon your Self while you hold these images.</p>

<p>10.16 When I call you to replace conviction with reliance, I call you to
replace belief in an outside source with reliance upon your Self.</p>

<p>10.17 Part of the difficulty you find in accepting reliance on your Self
is what you have “learned” within this Course. As you “learned” to
remove the ego and deny the personal self, you transferred your reliance
to me and to the state of unity. This was purposeful. Now, however, you
are asked to return to wholeness, a state in which you are not separate
from me or from the state of union.</p>

<p>10.18 You have “learned” the distinction between Christ-consciousness
and the man Jesus. You have “learned” the distinction between your Self
and the man or woman you are. Now you are called to forget what you have
“learned” and to let all distinctions slip away. You are called to
forget what you have learned and to realize what you know.</p>

<p>10.19 Thus I will speak to you from this point onward as the voice of
Christ-consciousness, the voice of your own true consciousness, the
consciousness that we truly share. I came to you in the form of the
consciousness of the man I once was because you were, prior to this
point, unready to give up image for presence, the individual for the
universal, reliance on an outside source for reliance on yourself, Jesus
for Christ-consciousness. You needed the reference point of a “person,”
of a being who had lived and breathed and met challenges similar to your
own. You have been unable to see the two as the same for you have not
realized this sameness in yourself. This sameness of the person you are
and Christ-consciousness, of union and presence, of the individual and
the universal, is what the elevated Self of form must encompass.</p>

<p>10.20 I ask you not to give up your relationship with me as the man
Jesus, but to accept that the man Jesus was simply a representation, in
form, of Christ-consciousness. I do, however, ask you to give up your
identification of the voice of this dialogue as that belonging to the
man Jesus who lived two thousand years ago. To continue to identify this
voice with that man is to be unable to recognize this voice as the voice
of your own true consciousness—the voice of Christ-consciousness. Yet to
realize that this is the same voice that animated the man Jesus two
thousand years ago will aide you in realizing that this is the voice
that will now animate the elevated Self of form, or in other words, you.</p>

<p>10.21 I have spoken with you throughout this time as the man Jesus so
that you realize that man and Christ-consciousness can be joined. That
you, as man or woman, existing in this particular time and space, can
join with Christ-consciousness. You can be both/and, rather than
either/or. As I speak to you now as the voice of Christ-consciousness—as
your own true Self— you will not have lost Jesus as your companion and
helpmate but will only know more fully the content of the man Jesus. As
you join with Christ-consciousness in this dialogue, you will realize
you have not lost your Self but will only know more fully the content of
your Self.</p>

<p>10.22 Remember that you have been told since the beginning of A Course
of Love that the answers that you seek lie within, and that their source
is your own true identity. You have been told since the beginning of
this Course that this is the time of the second coming of Christ. What
we have just discussed is what both of these statements mean. This is
the culmination point of these two great objectives coming together in
you and your brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>10.23 I will still be with you to point the way, but if you can cease to
think of this as the wisdom of an outside source, if you can hear it and
feel it and think of it as a true dialogue, a true sharing in
relationship in which an exchange is taking place, you will further your
progress greatly.</p>

<p>10.24 Let us talk a moment of this exchange, for it is a key to your
understanding of your Self and your power. This dialogue, as one-sided
as it may seem when presented in this way, is an exchange and will only
become more so as we proceed. I am not imparting wisdom that you are
unaware of but reminding you of what you have forgotten. I am not having
a monologue, but we are having a dialogue in which you are a full
participant. As much of what you read in these dialogues comes from your
own heart and those of your brothers and sisters in Christ as it does
from me. It comes, in truth, from our union, from the consciousness we
share. This shared consciousness is the source of wisdom because it is
shared—shared in unity and relationship.</p>

<p>10.25 Before we move on to the all-important discussion of unity and
relationship, let me spend my final time with you as the man Jesus
talking more of feelings.</p>

<p>10.26 It is highly unlikely that in your image of an ideal self you left
much room for feelings of the type you currently experience. This is why
we have recently spoken of anger and of those things which you
dislike—why we have spoken, in short, of the feelings you would think
would have no place within the ideal self or the elevated Self of form.</p>

<p>10.27 I asked you once before to review your ideas about the afterlife,
a life in which most of you believe peacefulness reigns and the spirit
is free of the body. Yet if you were to think now of a person whom you
know who has died, you would not be likely to think of them much
differently than they were in life, even while you are able to imagine
them being peaceful and free of the constraints of the body. This is as
good an idea as I can give you of how to imagine the elevated Self of
form, as not much different than you are now, but peaceful and free of
the constraints of the body.</p>

<p>10.28 Let’s continue with this idea a while longer as you consider a
particular person you fondly remember from life and how you have thought
of him or her since death. Do you not occasionally think that this
person would be happy or sad to see you in the state you are in when you
think of them? Do you not at times shake your head and think that a dead
loved one was lucky not to have lived to see the current state of
affairs of the world because you know they would not have liked it? And
do you not, in all honesty, think that even in whatever form or lack of
form they now occupy, they do not like it, even now, even beyond the
grave?</p>

<p>10.29 And do you not, when thinking of idolized spiritual leaders, see
them as world leaders as well, leaders not only capable but bound to
taking a stance against the many situations there are to dislike in the
world? Do they not feel for the suffering? Do they not dislike poverty?
Are they not called upon at times to take unpopular stands against
popular leaders? Do not even your ideas of saints and angels include
concepts of their feeling compassion and mercy, and of their acting upon
those feelings by championing the cause of good over that of evil or of
the powerless over the powerful? Isn’t history replete with idols who
have done just this?</p>

<p>10.30 I am not calling you to be as these people are or were or to act
as these people have, but I am calling you to acknowledge that feelings
are involved at every level of every being you can imagine.
Consciousness is about what you are aware of, not about what you think.
And you are very much aware of your feelings.</p>

<p>10.31 If you are being called to acknowledge these feelings, what are
you being called to do with them? You are being called to respond to
them with acceptance and love. As a man, I took a stand for the
powerless and called them to power. I am still doing so. Not because any
of you are powerless but because you do not know your power. If there is
one thing associated with my life more so than any other, it was this. I
was an advocate for all to know their power. Do you think that my
advocacy was a social statement for the times in which I lived? Or do
you not see that it is the same now as then?</p>

<p>10.32 All the issues that those you would call spiritual leaders are
called to champion or censor have their roots in timeless and universal
spiritual truths. It is the timeless and universal that you are called,
in unity, to respond to and with. But this response will not be
generated without the feelings that precede them! When speaking of
gossip we used a simple example of a relatively harmless situation. When
speaking of the many issues facing your world in this time, we are
speaking of situations that would seem to be extreme and to call for
extreme measures. The only extreme measure called for now is the same
extreme measure that I called for during my life. It is the call to
embrace your power.</p>

<p>10.33 My dear brothers and sisters in Christ, turn your thoughts not to
ideals of social activism, to causes, or to championing any one side
over another.  Turn not to your thoughts but to your feelings and go
where they lead. And everywhere they lead you, remember one thing only.
Remember to embrace your power. The power of love is the cause and
effect that will change the world by returning you, and all your
brothers and sisters, to who they are in truth. This cannot be done from
without but must be done from within. It is the transformation that is
caused within that will affect the world without.</p>

<p>10.34 The power you must come to rely upon is the power of your own Self
to create and express the cause and effect that is the power of love.</p>

<p>10.35 Although I need no awareness of the issues facing your time in
order to speak to you of such things, I am aware of them. So is every
other living thing because all that lives exists in relationship. What I
have often referred to as the urgency of this time has been partially
because of these issues and partially because of your readiness. It is
no accident that these two aspects of urgency are converging. When your
reliance on all that exists apart from your Self—your reliance on
science and technology and medicine and military might—has been shown to
be unfounded, a new source of reliable power is finally sought with the
tenacity with which these other sources of seeming power have been
sought. This is what has occurred. This is the time at which we stand.</p>

<p>10.36 All of the solutions to the issues facing the world and those who
live upon it have been pursued separately from one another and from God—
until recently. Now unity is being sought and unity is being found.</p>

<p>10.37 But these issues, when removed from feelings, still remain issues.
They remain social causes, environmental causes, political causes. The
cause of all these issues is fear. The cause and effect of love is all
that will replace these causes of fear with the means and end that will
transform them along with you. You are means and end. It is within your
power to be saviors of the world. It is from within that your power will
save the world.</p>

<p>10.38 As you can see, it is difficult for me, even now, even in this
final address to you as the man Jesus, to speak of feelings without
addressing the grand scheme of things. I want to comfort and reassure
you in this final message.  I want to tell you to be embraced by love
and to let all the feelings of love flowing through you now find their
expression. I desire, more than anything, your happiness, your peace,
and your acceptance of the power that will cause these things to come to
be. Yet I know you and what you want to hear. I know you have long
waited for your feelings to be addressed in a more personal way. But
please remember that none of the approaches that have been used to
“address” your feelings in the way you might desire have worked. This
will work.</p>

<p>10.39 This is the secret of succession, your promised inheritance. This
is the gift of love I came to give and give newly now, to you. Blessed

tenderness for each other and the world. This is unity. This will save
us. This will save the world.</p>
