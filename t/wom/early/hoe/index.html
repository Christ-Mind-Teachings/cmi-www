    <p>Now, we begin.</p>

<p>And, indeed, once again, greetings unto you, beloved and holy friends. In truth, all
that occurs within your dimension is not unknown or unavailable to us. For where
we abide (and there are many of us), we abide in a state of consciousness in which
the transmutation of energies through your third-dimensional realm are entirely
observable by us. Yes, this does mean that there is not at any time a true state of
privacy—if by privacy you mean secrecy and avoidance of relationship. This means
that, as you call to yourself your physical earth plane experience, in <em>each and every
moment</em>, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not, you are in relationship with
the whole of Creation. And the quality of that relationship is what mirrors back to you
the state of consciousness that you are choosing to abide within.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, always wise to look clearly and honestly at the nature of your moment-
to-moment experience. What are you truly aware of <em>now</em>? What thoughts are you
permitting to flow through the mind? What feelings are those thoughts generating
within the field of energy that you call the body?</p>

<p>Why is this important? To come to where I am requires a complete transcendence of
the physical domain or experience—not an escape <em>from</em>, for transcendence does not
rest on escape. Transcendence can <em>only</em> rest on <em>embracing</em>. For how can you transcend
what you refuse to acknowledge as a part of your experience? Therefore, the heart and
mind that is willing to utilize each and every moment of its experience in whatever
domain or dimension it finds itself existing within, is that heart and that mind that
will indeed come to where I am: to the finality of what you might call evolution, in
which <em>all</em> seeking has ended, in which the <em>need</em> for experience is over, where there is
not one question, and not one doubt.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you will, such a state in which you abide in such perfect wakefulness that
the mind does not even entertain the <em>thought</em> of desiring a physical form through which
to funnel a limited sphere of experience. A state of being in which, by simply turning
the attention of your consciousness, you can abide anywhere you wish in a moment’s
notice: actually, even quicker than that. That, just by turning your consciousness, you
can abide in any time frame within the physical dimension: to observe it, to interact
with it, to bring your wisdom to it. To turn your consciousness to a dimension and a
time frame seemingly far removed from where you are upon the earth, and all in the
twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>These things are your potential. They were placed within you in the moment of your
creation. And if you would well receive it, you have <em>already experienced</em> the state in
which I am, and there is a part of you that has never left that state. What then has
occurred? For look well upon what your experience is in <em>this moment</em>. Where do you
find yourself sitting or standing? What is the climate of your environment: is it noisy,
is it chaotic? Have you lit a few candles and burned your incense, have you played
some of your favorite music so you can begin to evoke a physiological change in the
body that you will then call a state of peace?—as if peace were dependent upon the
body. To each and every one of you, wherever you are in <em>this moment</em>: stop. Observe
the things around you, and the things within you. For there is a very direct correlation
between the two. For what you see around you expresses a quality of energy, a form
of experience, that emanates from the quality of thought that you have been willing
to entertain and to <em>allow</em> to enter into the field of your energy, into your domain. And
from this choice, you look out upon a world that you have chosen to create.</p>

<p>I have chosen to look out upon you and to recognize that you are my brothers and
my sisters. I have chosen to learn to look out and see <em>only</em> the Light of Christ within
you. That Light—that shines radiantly beyond all limitations—it is that Light that I
speak to, that Light that I come to, that Light that I join with, not only in this manner
of communication but through your dreams and in the space between the thoughts
you would choose to think.</p>

<p>If this is so, it must mean that what you are seeking is already within you. And that
perhaps the pathway of transcendence rests not on <em>efforting</em> or <em>striving</em>, but on <em>wondering</em>.
Perhaps it rests upon looking at all that you see and accepting the fact that you have no
idea what it is, how it has arisen, where it has come from, what it could possibly mean,
or where it’s going. Perhaps the pathway of awakening requires that—after all seeking
and all attempts to learn magical formulas to draw enlightenment to you—perhaps it
truly rests on the recognition of a state of humility in which you finally acknowledge
that you have moved nowhere and made no progress. Oh, yes, you’ve called to
yourself many experiences, high and low, and yet none of them has sufficed to help
you transcend your common or ordinary or consistent state of being. No matter how
good the love-making is, no matter how good the food, no matter how delicious the
states of consciousness in meditation, still you find yourself coming back to states of
being painfully familiar.</p>

<p>What, then, is the key? It rests in only this: to begin at the end. To first acknowledge,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In reality, I have never changed. In reality, I am as God has created me to be. In reality, I
have already tasted all experience and there is nothing new under the Heaven of my
consciousness. I am perfect and whole now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From that choice it then follows that you can begin to accept that, regardless of what
you think you <em>see</em> and what you think you’re <em>experiencing</em>, there is a depth of wisdom
within you that can bring enlightenment from the higher self, if you will, from the
soul, down to the levels of the personality, all the way into the cellular structure of the
body—if that be your true desire.</p>

<p>The true pathway home, then, my precious, precious friends, rests on the willingness
to withdraw the value that you have placed on all of the perceptions <em>you</em> have created.
To be willing to stand with empty hands. To look upon an object, a person, an event,
a feeling, and to begin with the thought,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am whole and perfect, and I am bringing the light of my infinite consciousness to shine
upon this mysterious phenomena that has arisen in front of me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or ‘within’ me if you call the body within you: it, too, is on the outside in some
sense. And to acknowledge that you are beholding Mystery, and that you cannot rely
on your own ideas to understand anything. <em>That</em> is the beginning of wisdom.</p>

<p>For if you cannot rely upon yourself, what are you going to do? You could try
committing suicide, but all that does is dispose of a certain body; <em>you</em> remain. You
can try to distract yourself with the ordinary phenomena of cultures. That doesn’t
work, either. In the end, you must <em>submit</em> yourself to something which is, in truth,
the grandest mystery of all: the presence of the Holy Spirit. You must surrender your
self—all of your ideas about what you think is true—and ask that something you can’t
even see (and, at least in the beginning, you can’t even hear), to ask some mysterious
<em>something</em> to teach you the truth of Reality. It feels very much like dying. And, in
truth, it is the only true death—the giving up and surrendering of your justifications
for anger, your rationalizations for judgment, your <em>certainty</em> that what you <em>know</em> is true.</p>

<p>The acceptance that what you have called ‘knowledge’ is highly suspect, indeed. For,
if you believe you are a body in space and time, and if you look out and see a limited
world, you are therefore using a limited consciousness to decide that <em>you</em> know what
the whole of Creation is. And the part can never comprehend the whole.</p>

<p>Yet, paradoxically, there is within you that which is already the wholeness itself,
the Mind of Christ, and that which rests within you is a perfect wisdom, a perfect
peace, a perfect knowingness, is ready to speak to you (so to speak), to speak to your
consciousness so that you actually and literally have an <em>awareness of being the wholeness of
creation</em>. Even though the body still seems to be right as it is, even though the objects
seem to be around you, imagine seeing through them as though they were transparent
and beholding all distant realms, and all past and all future, in the twinkling of an
eye. And allowing that state to be the normal state in which you operate, even while
the body seems to last for yet a little while. All this is possible, and more, when you
first use the <em>power of choice</em> given unto you to dedicate each and every moment of
your awareness—notice I said your awareness, not your experience. Dedicating each
moment of your <em>awareness</em> to the process of surrendering everything that you thought
 knew and needed to hold onto, to allow a mysterious <em>something</em> to bring the grace
of enlightenment to you.</p>

<p>Beloved friends, you who seem to find yourself in this third-dimensional realm,
this physical realm of limitation and duality and conflict, and birth and death—and
surprises? Hm! Rest assured you have truly never surprised yourself at any time. There
has never been a moment’s experienced that has come to you that you have not
<em>deliberately</em> ordered and received. Nothing comes by accident.</p>

<p>And, of course, you are quite free to choose how to perceive what comes to you.
And if you allow that mysterious <em>something</em> to teach you anew, what once horrified
you can now bring a smile to your face; what once seemed insurmountable can seem
like the smallest of stepping stones beneath your toes. All power under Heaven and
Earth is given unto you to create as you are created in each moment, from and within
perfect unlimitedness. And now here’s the real secret: you are literally and exactly
doing this all the time. You never lose the power of the infinite being that you are;
you cannot lose what God has created, or God herself is limited. You, as you are right
now, with every breath you breathe, with every thought you think, with every action
you perform (even if you have no body), you are literally and always using the infinite
power of <em>your wisdom</em> to create. That is the only thing you’ve ever been doing.</p>

<p>And you have therefore created heavens and numerous hells. And in those hells you
have created an infinite number of shades or hues or vibrations. You can just as easily
create as many heavens blessed with shimmering, beautiful light that the earth has not
seen for quite some time. In each moment of your day, <em>nothing outside of you</em> causes
your feelings and your perceptions. Does this mean that, if you experience another
soul, another human being, that they themselves do not carry certain frequencies
of energy that you can detect? Of course not. But the detecting of energy from the
field of another mind does not <em>cause</em> you to perceive them in any way at all. You
will therefore perceive them as you <em>choose</em> to perceive them, regardless of their name,
regardless of their action. You are the one who is free to see that your power to choose
your perceptions is a power that overwhelms and transmutes anything and everything
that your world can direct at you.</p>

<p>I hope that this is beginning to sink in, because it is an extremely important message.
I want you to truly spend some time each day in the simplest of actions. You might
simply be closing your fist and opening it again. You might feel your feet upon the
earth as you walk forward in a direction of your choosing (and all of your directions
are of your choosing). Whatever you choose to bring your attention to, notice
with perfect wonder and awe that <em>you</em> are <em>literally</em> choosing to create the experience
you’re having. Because this is true, Heaven on Earth is actually no further from your
experience than the width of the thoughts you are willing to think. <em>Heaven on Earth is
no further from you than the width of the thoughts you are willing to think.</em> Heaven on Earth
is not apart from where you are.</p>

<p>Would you, therefore, be willing to join with me in daring to think the thought of
a planet healed and a humanity enlightened? Are you willing to allow yourself—not
to run around with placards in your hand and placing billboards around what you call
your highways (we would perceive them as low-ways… hmm)—would you be willing
to allow yourself to rest in each of your days and simply feel the <em>reality</em> of Heaven on
Earth, and know that this has already come to pass? And in the field of time, it seems
to be taking time for that to occur. But, after all, that’s what time is about: process. In
reality, if you hold the thought, <em>it is done</em>. And, in truth, you can acknowledge it. For
what the Son of God decrees is—no matter the state of mind in which you decree
it—what you <em>say in that moment</em>, whether you speak it out loud, whether you merely
think the thought, you have literally created that reality. [Snaps fingers] That fast, in
the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>This seems like madness to your world because your world is madness. It is the
complete reversal of Christed Consciousness. The world represents the complete
<em>opposite</em> of Heaven. It is upside down and inside out. So that when I say unto you:
when you think the thought of Heaven and Earth, you have decreed it and it is so,
now, and you’re totally free to experience unlimited radiance, perfect peace, perfect
joy, right where you are—now! The world will say: that is nonsense. And this is the
theme of this hour’s discussion, for you to understand that right there is the point that
you <em>must begin</em> to make a new choice, to learn to think with the Mind of Christ rather
than against it. By choosing to think with it, you become it, and when you become
it, you realize a discovery: a discovery of what has always been and is never changed.
You are, indeed, and you forever remain, as you were created to be. You are the
creator of all worlds. And never, ever, ever, ever are you losing, or in a state of loss
of, your power to create precisely as God birthed you. That is how powerful you are,
right where you are.</p>

<p>And there are some of you, even now that listen to these words, and you think</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, that might be true for somebody else who’s a little more powerful, but you see, my
situation is such-and-such. I only have five dollars in my wallet!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look at the five dollars with <em>wonder</em>. Where on earth did it come from? It came
into your being and into your wallet because you decided to put it there. And you
can just as easily put a million of your golden coins there, if that is what you want
to experience. Nothing but your own thought expands you or limits you. No one
can create <em>for you</em>. No one can bring you the answers you seek—you are the answer
you seek. You have merely trained yourself to believe that you are less than you are.
You have trained yourself to believe that right now in this moment, as you reach to
scratch your cheek with your finger, or you hear the sound of a barking dog outside
your window, or you see the flash of sunlight as it begins to disappear beyond the
mountains to the west—and for some of you, by the way, if you happen to look out
and see the streak of light as it begins to rise in your eastern sky, for some of you
will listen to this early in the morning—if you believe that you’re just some ordinary
person trying to figure it all out, <em>stop where you are</em>. Look at what you see and truly see
it. You do not know what a single thing is. It is Mystery, and yet you have brought
it into form, even if it’s nothing more than the table in front of you.</p>

<p>How could it be that you’re experiencing a physical body in some city within your
twentieth century America? How could these things be? What has brought them to
be? You have—the infinite power of creation, sitting right where you are, choosing
to look like an ordinary human being. The same creativity that moves the sun and the
moon and stars, the same creativity that brought forth what your scientists would call
from the ‘big bang’, all forms of creation. The big bang, by the way, was nothing more
than an aha! in your Holy Mind as you dreamed up a new thought that had never been
thought of before: something called physical matter, a condensation of light.</p>

<p>If you can begin to truly understand, as you place your hand around your cup of tea
or your coffee, as these things are called, when you brush your teeth, when you watch
how the chest rises as you inhale—if you can truly look upon these things with awe
and with innocence, you can behold the mystery of Life itself. And you can come to
see that <em>you</em> are constantly, moment to moment to moment, manifesting world after
world after world after world. You are choosing where to be and how to be. <em>You</em>
are the one sent forth from the Holy Mind of God to be the agent of the forever
extending Creation.</p>

<p>I want to say, also—and this will seem very radical to many of you yet still—you are
perfectly, completely free to create whatever you will. You are perfectly free in this
moment to go and sell all that you have and to take up your cross and follow me.
Some would say that means to become a rather bizarre radical. Hmm. I felt insane the
first time I dared to think the thought, “I and my Father are One,” just to try it on.
It created a tingling sensation from the crown of the head down through the body. It
was a sensation I had not yet experienced, but I liked it. And I decided to ask myself
this question: What would happen if I were to entertain that thought until it excluded
every other thought that seemed to swirl within the mind? What would occur?</p>

<p>For you see, many of you are wondering: Why cannot I seem to manifest what I
want to manifest? It is because you entertain conflicting thoughts. And where there is
conflict, there is stagnation. Be you therefore of single intent, bring the consciousness
to a single point in which the thought you would truly desire to manifest is the only
thought you imbue with reality. When you have mastered the ability to discipline
the mind, you will discover that you can create an entire universe with one thought.
You will discover that you can literally create a golden coin in the palm of your hand,
merely by holding the thought of it. And if this is true, and I assure you that it is, you
will be the bearer of miracles. And lo and behold, you might dare to think the thought
of Heaven on Earth and put all of your focused intention on that one thought until
it is your only reality and nothing else matters, nothing else holds value, nothing else
can exist for you. And if the rest of the world thinks you’re crazy, so what? That, too,
is just a thought. You can bring Heaven to Earth in the twinkling of an eye. And it
will come to pass that Heaven on Earth will be the case, and when it is established, it
will seem to have occurred effortlessly in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>Why? Because enough of you will have chosen to energize that thought, and only
that thought. You will live that thought, you will drink that thought, you will dream
that thought, you will extend that thought, you will feel and live that thought to the
exclusion of anything that could contradict it, or be in dissonance with it; and then you
will be the <em>embodiment</em> of Heaven on Earth. And the time will come, in time, when
suddenly the whole of humanity gets it, in the twinkling of an eye. And in that very
moment, that which is called the pollution of your waters and airs will vanish as if it
had never been. That which is called strife between races will vanish as if it had never
been. Anything you can imagine representing conflict will vanish from the face of the
Earth. And why? Because the Holy Son of God, manifested as the family of mankind,
will have moved sufficiently into a momentum that creates the stabilization of one
and only one thought: Heaven on Earth. That fast, without blinking an eye, without
lifting an hand. That is what you’re struggling toward as a collective consciousness.</p>

<p>You are beginning to discover, from your scientists, that you can literally create what
is called virtual reality. Well, guess what? That’s what you’ve been doing all along
anyway. Manifesting on this physical third dimension virtual reality, which means
pretty close to the real thing. Hmm. Think about that. For as long as mankind has
been on your earth—and there have been many generations and many civilizations,
great civilizations that have risen and fallen and been washed away, that your scientists
and archaeologists know nothing of and can’t even believe could have ever been;
cultures so far beyond the one you now live in that yours becomes archaic and
primitive—and, yet, all of them are an aspect of virtual reality. Heaven on Earth
will be the final happy dream that can be made manifest in the physical dimension,
reflecting to all consciousnesses the truth of consciousness itself. Heaven on Earth will
last but for the twinkling of an eye. And then even this physical dimension will be as a
thought that had never been dreamt of, as the Holy Son of God returns to take up his
rightful place at the right hand of God—which just means right-mindedness, creating
only what is unlimited and without conflict, only that which mirrors and reflects the
vast grandness of His radiance.</p>

<p>And now here’s the paradox: You can’t wait for that to happen, because you are the
one through whom it occurs, and yet you can’t bring it about. You can only allow
that mysterious something to accomplish it for you and through you. I once said that
it is important to become again as a little child. And now we come to a clear and
deeper and more presently meaningful interpretation of that teaching. For a little child
surrenders the need to be the maker and the doer. The child just holds the thought.
It wakes up in the morning and says, “Ha, I’m hungry, I wish to be fed.” And, voila,
the mother appears at the door and says, “Oh, my little child, are you hungry? Shall
I feed you?” And the child says, “Well, of course, why do you think I called you
here?” Hm. Creation. The child <em>submits</em> to something beyond itself to bring about the
manifestation of its thought.</p>

<p>Does that makes sense to you? Can you become the innocent child who first dares to
dream the unbelievable dream, the dream of Heaven on Earth. It seems so outrageous
to mankind. Are you willing to dare to let into your consciousnesses light seeping
through a crack in the wall, the fortress you have built against the Kingdom of
Heaven, the thought,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I and my Father are One. I am Christ incarnate. How about that!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right here, wearing my Nikes and my Levis and my (what do you call this with the…)
New York Yankees baseball hat upon your head. You are the incarnation of Christ
pretending to be human so as to be in relationship with a lot of sleeping minds. Dare
you, therefore, to think the outrageous and improbable? Dare you to contemplate,
and to allow with wonder, that there is a mysterious something that can bring forth
your highest creative thoughts when those thoughts are in alignment with the way
God thinks. And God thinks only in terms of effortlessness, joy, unlimitedness,
expansion—and Love. Love. Love!</p>

<p>Do you know what has frustrated your attempt to be the maker and creator of your
world? Fear. And fear is the opposite of Love. <em>Love</em> is the essential energy of the mind
of God. Yet how many times have you prayed for a new job or a new career, a new
relationship, or a new washer and dryer, because you <em>fear</em> not having these things?
Because you fear survival, which is already to hold an insane thought: what could you
survive? You are Life eternal, and it will never be taken from you. You try to hold
your reality together through your attempts to be the maker and the doer because you
<em>fear</em> letting go of them. And yet, in truth, it is nothing more than the fear of the child
letting go of an invisible monster under the bed. But where you choose to create from
loving thoughts, the universe, that unseen something I call the Holy Spirit, can begin
to blend with the energy of your consciousness and begin to bring forth manifestations
that reflect the vibrational quality of Love. And Love is that which <em>heals</em>. Love is that
which <em>forgives</em>. Love is that which creates the space for a mind and heart to choose
again. For you see, that is the energy in which God sustains you with every breath,
creating the space for His creation to create anew.</p>

<p>Love. What would it mean for you to go through each of your days and ask yourself
honestly,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this action I am performing, is this thought I’m thinking, is this grounded in my desire
to extend and teach only Love?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of you will become quite frightened to discover that ninety-eight percent of
what you do is not founded in love at all, but in fear. Therefore, if that is the case,
learn to embrace fear itself. Ask of it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where do you come from? What am I truly afraid of? Can I feel that feeling? Can I embrace
that thought? Can I embrace the whole idea, the perception, that is causing me to choose
actions out of a desire to survive, out of a desire to control another, out of a desire to prove
to myself that I am unworthy of unlimitedness?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Love. To think only from the foundation of Love is to return to your rightful place,
in which Creation flows through you as the vehicle of manifestation. Yet what flows
through you is no longer yours. You are the enjoyer, the witness of grand Mystery.
You are free. You are awake. You are at peace. You are home. You are Christ.</p>

<p>Imagine a life in which all of your creations were wholly loving. That is the same as
Heaven on Earth.</p>

<p>So you see, there’s never been a single thing that has <em>caused</em> you to be fearful. Fear itself
can only arise as a chosen creation from the infinite and all-powerful Mind that you
are. If you could look behind your mind in any instant when events or whatever it is
seems to unfold, and you begin to feel fearful, you begin to react out of that fear, if
you could take one step behind the stage curtain, you would discover yourself saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the depth of the Christ I am, I choose now to create a fearful world and the experience
of fear and all that comes with it—and I step into that creation now!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there you have it. The experience you’re having that seems to be causing your
conflict. Hm. That does rather take away excuses. And it takes away blame. For even
your most fearful creations can be embraced with perfect innocence. And why? Listen
carefully: All that you see in the realm of beginnings and endings is an illusion. It is
a momentary, a temporary, call it a modification of the creative energy that flows
through you. You’ve just sculpted it for a moment. But think on this: Has there ever
been anything you have attempted to create from a non-loving space?</p>

<p>So, the theme of this sharing with you will come to have its point, as it will begin to be
a building block upon which we will build Heaven on Earth within <em>your</em> consciousness.
For if you are listening to these words now, created out of a free and unconditioned
blending of two minds—two minds that are willing to love one another so wholly
that nothing can serve as a barrier to their joining and to their creations—as we build
upon this foundation, your life is going to change, as it must. For if you are listening
to these words, there is already a part of <em>you</em> that has heard the call to awaken and to
bring Heaven to Earth. To dare to join with the most insane thought that has ever
penetrated the myopic and narrow field of consciousness called humanity. What you
could almost say is nothing more than the attempt to resist unlimitedness.</p>

<p>Into egoic consciousness there crept a tiny, mad idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would it be like to have Heaven on Earth? That’s insane. I can’t think that thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next day:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would it be like if all the waters were running purely and all the children were well
fed and loved?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of you, each and every one of you now listening to these words—each and every
one of you is a being, a soul, an entity, call it what you will, a focus of unlimited
creative potential, a spark of Divine Light. You are one that has already allowed such
thoughts to begin to seep into your consciousness. And the first thing it does is it
begins to create a polarization within you, because as Light begins to descend into the
mind, and then also down into the personality and body, it’s much like turning on a
light switch, and the first thing you see is all of the things within your consciousness
that are <em>unlike</em> the thought of Heaven on Earth. That are unlike the thought of being
the presence of Christ. That are unlike the thought of “I and my Father are One.”</p>

<p>And sometimes it seems to be not a pretty sight. And, yet, it is a very necessary process
for you <em>want</em> to learn to shed light with wonder and awe and innocence upon all of
your miscreations. To wonder about how such a thing could ever arise: a thought
of judgment, a thought of fear, a thought of lack, a thought of limitation. Let that
mysterious something shine the Light of Truth upon everything within your field of
being that is unlike the simplicity of Love. For the shining of that Light upon it already
begins to dissolve it from your consciousness.</p>

<p>This is why I once said that it is not necessary to seek for Love. It is only necessary to
seek for all of the ways in which you have blocked Love from being your only reality.
<em>That</em> is your purpose, that is the gift of time, to ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How in this moment am I using the infinite power of my beingness to create something which
is less than Love, something less than what I truly want?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tape, then, is the first in a series that will be shared with you through this
vehicle, through this joining, in which many of us, what you would call teachers,
friends, masters, will come to teach you how consciousness works and how to begin
to re-discipline the focus of your mind so it becomes like a laser, unwilling to see
anything less than Love.</p>

<p>We want then to suggest also that those of you who are listening to these words take
the time to re-listen to them on several occasions. Do this in a very relaxed state
of mind, not trying to grasp each and every word, but allowing certain phrases and
words to strike you. And the ones that strike you, write them down. And then begin a
process of writing those words and phrases consistently in each of your days for at least
fifteen or twenty minutes, in a state of aimlessness and innocence. Write the phrases
and the words that have <em>struck</em> you, for it is that which strikes the <em>emotional</em> body that
begins to create the space for something new to be birthed through you. Rest assured,
you are not alone. You’ve never had any privacy. We see it all—and it’s okay.</p>

<p>With that, we are going to take pause for just a few moments, for there will be some
questions that will be asked by those present. Many of you will be a bit startled to
realize that they’re the very questions that are on your mind. Be at peace then, and
now we will pause to wonder what the question is.</p>

<p>[Break]</p>

<p>We were just speaking then, as we return, that when a question comes into your
consciousness, it comes for a reason. Because questions—listen carefully—questions
are what form the basis and indeed sculpt the answer that you will discover. Therefore,
if you want the greatest of answers, ask the greatest of questions. If you want clarity to
come to you, be clear in the questions you are asking of yourself and of the universe.</p>

<p>A question, once it arises, is an impulse of energy that has come into your consciousness,
and it is designed to help you expand from a contracted state. A question, once that
impulse enters into the consciousness, into the mind, that question never leaves until
you allow the answer to be realized and integrated into your being. And in that very
moment, the old ‘you’ has died, and you will never return to it. Therefore, why not
ask questions such as,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I be the presence of Christ?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible for me to manifest miracles?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I choose peace in any circumstance?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rest assured that by asking such questions you literally begin to redirect how you
create your experience <em>so that</em> you discover the answer. Therefore, if you desire to
bring Heaven to Earth, rather than looking upon the world as you think it is and
saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, my God, what a big task I have,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>why not simply ask,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hmm… How is it that Heaven can come to Earth through me in this moment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer will not be hidden.</p>

<p>And so, with that, have you questions?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-one">Question One</h2>

<p class="omit"><a href="/t/wom/early/hoe/q1/"><em>Question</em></a>: It’s the first time in
feeling the sense of wonder that you’re inviting me and us into,
that I’m approaching—I usually experience goals and desires
as kind of burdensome, but it’s the first time I’m feeling a
certain goal that I really like is something that I can approach in the
spirit of fun. And I don’t even really know what my question is,
but I know that’s what I want to talk to you about.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-two">Question Two</h2>

<p class="omit"><a href="/t/wom/early/hoe/q2/"><em>Question</em></a>: The question is how to develop a
greater clarity and discernment around wearing one’s own emotional
body and energy and staying clear with that and not, so to speak, take
on the cloak or clothes of another’s emotional body and wearing
theirs?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-three">Question Three</h2>

<p class="omit"><a href="/t/wom/early/hoe/q3/"><em>Question</em></a>: Jeshua, what is like to live the
Christ vibration in 3-D?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-four">Question Four</h2>

<p class="omit"><a href="/t/wom/early/hoe/q4/"><em>Question</em></a>: The question has arisen about the
Shanti Christo membership, and the comment was that it was
‘exclusive’ to have tapes only go to members. And the
question is—what is the question? For those not able to manifest
the means to become a member right now, whether the Shanti Christo play
in that role to open up and extend tapes to those?  What’s your
view on that?</p>
