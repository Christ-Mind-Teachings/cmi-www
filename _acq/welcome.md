The library is a collection of authoritative channeled insight and inspiration
that offers a perspective on the individual and collective challenges of our
lives and world that is not commonly taught. For many, this new perspective is
immediately grasped as the only real solution to the problems of the world,
from little annoyances to major conflict and from those of a personal nature to
those that have global effect.

The books in the library express a similar message but each source presents it
in a different way and often using somewhat different language. The content is
the same, just the form differs. The variety of forms of teachings support a
deeper understanding of the material.

The library is organized by teaching or *source* and each source contains one
or more *books*. The [home page](/) displays an image that represents each
source in the Library and a *Get Acquainted* guide containing details of the features
of the site and other potentially useful information.

To navigate to a source teaching, click on its book image. Clicking on the image will display
the table of contents for a book within the home page of a teaching.

See the [Quick Start](/acq/quick/) to learn the basics of navigating and using the features of
the site.
