    <p>21.1 The truth is not a set of facts. Written truth is not the truth but
only the arrangement of the truth into language. You have a birth
certificate that states the truth about your birth. The birth
certificate is not the truth but symbolic of the truth.</p>

<p>21.2 The truth is not symbolic. It is. It is the same for everyone.</p>

<p>21.3 There are no two sides to the truth. There is not more than one
truth.  There is one truth.</p>

<p>21.4 The truth is not a concept. It is real. It is all that is real.</p>

<p>21.5 Your real Self exists in truth. It does not exist in illusion.</p>

<p>21.6 Your personal self exists in illusion. It is called a personal self
because it is attached to a person. A person is a being born into time,
a being whose existence began in time and will end in time.</p>

<p>21.7 The only means for the personal self and the true Self to exist
together is for the truth to be lived in time. In order for the truth to
be lived in time you must forget your uncertainty and be certain of the
truth.</p>

<p>21.8 This certainty is antithetical to you. You think that to believe in
one truth is to deny other truths. There is only one truth. Untruth must
now be denied.</p>

<p>21.9 This will sound intolerant to you. It is a stance intolerant of
illusion.  You must no longer see illusion for it is no longer there!
This is how you must live with it. You must live with it as you once
lived with the truth.  You must find it unobservable! It must become a
concept only. Illusion is a set of facts, or in other words, a set of
information. These facts are subject to change and mean one thing to one
person and one thing to another.  Illusion is symbolic. And what’s more
it symbolizes nothing for it does not symbolize what is!</p>

<p>21.10 This is your conundrum. When you have never known what is you have
never been able to be certain. You have no experience with certainty
other than—and this is a crucial other than—your certainty of your own
identity, the very identity this Course has disproved. This identity has
been seen as your personal self. Thus your personal self is the only
place in which you have experience that can now be used for a new
purpose.</p>

<p>21.11 Even while this experience is experience of an ego-self, it is
still an experience as near to certainty as you have been capable,
simply because you could not exist without an identity. You might think
of this as being certain of facts and information, for these are the
things about yourself that few of you have doubted. Those who have had
cause to doubt circumstances of their birth are often consumed with a
desire to discover these unknown circumstances. For your birth, your
name, the history of your family and the accumulated experiences of your
lifetime are the things upon which you draw to feel the certainty you
feel about your personal self. You identify yourself as male or female,
married or single, homosexual or heterosexual.  You might call
yourselves Chinese or Lebanese or American, black or white or Indian.
Your personal self may be deeply affected by these things you call
yourself or may be minimally affected.</p>

<p>21.12 And even more so than these things, although this hasn’t as often
been considered as part of what makes you certain of your personal self,
are the thoughts of your mind, thoughts that while certainly changeable,
are unmistakably claimed to be your own in the way few things, in
addition to your name and family of origin ever are. Even the most
materialistic among you rarely count what you have acquired in form as
part of your identity.  What you have acquired that is not of form, you
have, however, added to the few ideas that you hold certain. A degree
earned or talent developed is seen as part of your identity, as part of
who you are.</p>

<p>21.13 So too is it with beliefs. Many of you have a religious identity
as well as a professional identity. Many of you have political or
philosophical identities. You may call yourself Christian or doctor or
Democrat. You may have beliefs you hold strongly, such as a stance
against capital punishment or in favor of equal rights or environmental
protection. And you may, even while recognizing, as you surely do, that
these beliefs are subject to change, hold yourself to behaviors that
fall within the parameters of your belief system.  You think of these
things as part of what make up the totality of who you are, of your
personal self.</p>

<p>21.14 So it can be seen that there are several aspects to your personal
self: a historical aspect, an aspect we will call self-image, and an
aspect that has to do with beliefs.</p>

<p>21.15 The historical aspect is based upon your family of origin, its
history, and on the life you have led since your birth. The self-image
aspect is based upon your race, ethnicity, culture, body size and shape,
sex and sexual preferences, and so on. The aspect that has to do with
beliefs is linked to your thoughts and ideas about the world you live in
and the “type” of person you feel you have chosen to be within that
world. Whether you have given thought to the interconnection of these
ideas you hold about yourself or not, they exist. Your world-view, and
your view of your personal self, are inextricably bound together. In
other words, the world you were born into, regardless that it was the
same world as all other human beings were born into, is also different
than that of all other human beings. And what’s more, your experiences
within that world are also different than the experiences of all other
human beings.</p>

<p>21.16 All of these things have contributed to your idea that you are a
separate being and as such incapable of truly understanding or knowing
your brothers and sisters, those whose personal selves and world view
cannot help but be different than your own—those whose thoughts are
surely as distinct and separate as are your own.</p>

<p>21.17 Now however, you are being called to accept your true identity
even while you retain the form of your personal self. As your true
identity is that of a Self who exists in unity and the identity of your
personal self is that of a self who exists in separation, this would
seem impossible. Even while your belief system has changed and you
believe that you exist in unity, all the things we have enumerated above
will act to challenge these beliefs unless you are able to see them in a
new light. No matter what you believe, while you have a body that is
different from all the rest, a name that distinguishes you from some and
yet links you with some, a nationality that separates you from other
nationalities and a sex that divides you from those “opposite” you,
unity will seem like a belief only.</p>

<p>21.18 Thus, certain things about your personal self must be accepted as
aspects of your form and cease to be accepted as aspects of your
identity. This will cause your existence to seem to have more of a
dualistic nature for a short time while you carry observance forward
into observance of your personal self. As was said at the beginning of
this Treatise, by the time the learning of this Treatise is complete,
the personal self will continue to exist only as the self you present to
others. It will be a representation only. It will represent only the
truth. It will no longer be seen as your identity, but as representing
your identity, an identity that has nothing to do with the thoughts of a
separated mind or the circumstances of the physical body.</p>

<p>21.19 And yet, what might seem contradictory is that I have said that we
can also use the certainty you have felt about your identity for our new
purpose, the purpose of the miracle that will allow you to exist as who
you are in human form. How, you might rightly ask, can you cease to
identify yourself as you always have and use the only identity you have
been certain of for a new purpose?</p>

<p>21.20 The answer too will seem contradictory, for the answer lies in
realizing that your former identity does not matter, even while
realizing that it will serve your new purpose. Further, there are even
two aspects to this contradictory seeming answer. One is that your
certainty regarding the identity of your personal self will be useful as
that certainty is translated to the thought system of the truth and aids
you in becoming certain of your true identity.  The second is that the
very differences that you seem to have will be seen as sameness by some
and will attract them to you and to the truth you now will represent.</p>

<p>21.21 While this has been called the time of Christ, it is obviously no
longer the time of Jesus Christ. My time came and my time ended. The
time when a single baby born of a virgin mother could change the world
has passed. The world is quite simply bigger now and the identities of
your personal selves split by far more than history and far more than
the oceans that separate east from west. This is why this call to return
to your Self is being sounded far and wide and why it goes out to humble
and ordinary people like yourself. There is no exclusivity to this call.
It excludes no race nor religion nor ones of either sex or sexual
preference. It but calls all to love and to live in the abundance of the
truth.</p>

<p>21.22 In other words, it will matter not that there will be no priest or
guru for those who seek the truth to turn to. It will matter not that a
black man will not turn to a white man or a Muslim to a Christian. It
will not matter if a young person looks to one his or her own age or
turns to someone older.  And yet it will matter that someone will look
at you and see that you are not so different than he or she. It will
matter that someone will look at you and be drawn to the truth of him-
or herself that is seen reflected there. What I am saying is that your
differences can serve our purpose until differences are no longer seen.
What I am saying is that you can remain confident in your personal self,
knowing that your personal self will serve those you are meant to serve.
What you have seen as your failings or weaknesses are as valuable as are
your successes and strengths. What has separated you will also unite
you.</p>

<p>21.23 It is not being said that anyone should, or will, remain blind to
the unity that exists beyond all barriers of seeming differences such as
those of race and religion. It is simply being said that they do not
matter. It will not matter if a person turns to someone “like” him- or
herself to find the truth, or if a person turns to someone totally
“unlike” him- or herself to find the truth.  As has been said many
times, willingness is the starting point and as can be surely
understood, where one is willing another may not be.</p>

<p>21.24 There is no “other” who can follow the call meant for you. No
other who can give the response you are meant to give. Do not make any
false plans that give your power to others more learned of this Course
than you to be the savior only you can be. Do not think that only those
who are more bold than you or who speak more eloquently or who are
better examples of a good and saintly life are those who will lead the
way for others to follow. Do not give in to the idea that one special
one is needed nor give to any one a role you would not claim for
yourself. No leaders and no followers are needed. This is quite
obviously an old way of thinking. While no one is called to evangelize,
all are called equally to represent the truth and to observance of the
truth.  That you each will do this in ways unique to who you are must be
further addressed and seen as it relates to the relationship between the
personal self and the Self; the truth and its representation and
observance.</p>
