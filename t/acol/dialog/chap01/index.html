    <p>1.1 Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,</p>

<p>1.2 I come to you today as co-Creator of the Self you are and the Self
you hope to represent with your physical form. I come to you today not
as a personal self who is “other” than you, but as a divine Self who is
the same as you. In our union we bear the sameness of the Son of God. In
going forth with the vision of unity you become as I was during life.
You “receive” and you “give” from the well of the spirit. You need not
prepare or plan, you need only to claim your inheritance, your gifts,
your Self.</p>

<p>1.3 What this means in practical terms is that you let the personal self
step back and the true Self step forward. Realize that all of your
“concerns” are still for the personal self, a self whom you continue to
believe can fail to fulfill or live your mission and your purpose. You
“see” this failure occurring through ineptness of speech, through
inappropriateness of attire, through lack of physical stamina, through
lack of intelligence—through lack, in other words, of abilities of the
personal self. As long as you “see” such visions, you “see” the pattern
of the personal self going forth much as it did before.  You do not
“see” the new, the new Self of elevated form or the true Self of divine
union. You “see” the separated self still “trying,” still “struggling,”
still fumbling along. You do not see the natural grace and order of the
universe extending into the realm of the elevated Self, the space of the
elevated Self.  As long as you see in this way, you keep the personal
self in the forefront rather than allowing and aiding the personal self
in the stepping back that is required in order for the true Self to step
forward.</p>

<p>1.4 All of this confusion and struggle is occurring because you do not
know what to do to prepare. You have not been convinced that you are
done preparing as you are done with learning. You still want to figure
out what to do, what comes next, what you need to learn, how to better
“prepare” for what is ahead.</p>

<p>1.5 And yet you know that you have been prepared by me, and that in
union with me you cannot fail. You cannot fail to be prepared, for you
are already accomplished. What will it now take for your mind to accept
this truth? For the mind’s acceptance of this truth is what is needed.</p>

<p>1.6 Your heart knows the reality of this truth, knows that this new
reality is real and different from the reality of old. Ideally, mind and
heart in union together accept this new reality and, with this
acceptance, the heart is freed to dwell in the house of the Lord, the
new world, the Kingdom that has already been prepared and so needs no
preparation.</p>

<p>1.7 This acceptance is crucial to the elevation of the personal self.
Without this acceptance the personal self must still struggle and try,
prepare and plan. It does not know how to do otherwise. You do not think
you know how to do otherwise.</p>

<p>1.8 This is the final surrender. The surrender of the control of the
personal self. Even with the ego gone, the personal self can continue to
move about within the world, a faceless and nameless entity, a being
without an identity, humble and selfless and ineffective. For there must
be cause to engender effect.</p>

<p>1.9 These anti-ego tendencies are a real danger in this time. You are
not called to selflessness but to Self!</p>

<p>1.10 This is the transition you have felt yourself to be in. The ego is
gone but the true Self has not been allowed as yet to dwell within the
personal self, thus elevating the personal self. You have thus been
self-less for a time and the personal self has floundered from this lack
of identity. A person could literally die during this time from lack of
identity, lack of cause. To die to the personal self is not what is
required any longer as we work instead to elevate the personal self.
This elevation occurs through the acceptance of your true identity, not
through being identity-less. The reign of the ego began during just such
a time of identity-less-ness. You cannot go on in such a way.</p>

<p>1.11 Help is here. Be what you have been called to be. Open your
dwelling place to your true Self, your true identity. Imagine this
opening and this replace- ment occurring with every fiber of your being.
Imagine the separate self being enfolded, embraced, and finally
consumed—taken into the Self of union. The body of Christ becomes real
through this indwelling of Christ in form.</p>

<p>1.12 This thought makes you worry about the identity of the one you have
called yourself. This has been the purpose of many renaming ceremonies
that symbolize the release of the old and the acceptance of the new.
This occurs in one form or another in the sacraments you have known as
Baptism, Confirmation, and Marriage. Each of these invite a new
identity.  So, too, do we invite a new identity now. While these
sacraments have largely lost their meaning, the sacrament I now call you
to restores meaning. Since new names are only symbols of new identities,
renaming is not required or expected here. We go beyond what can be
symbolized to what can only be known within. It is to this state of
grace that I call you now, today: The state of grace of the newly
identified child of God.</p>

<p>1.13 Open your heart, for the one who dwells there in union with all
will emerge from this opening. What was once a tiny pinprick of light
becomes a beacon as you open your heart and allow your true identity to
be what is, even within your form. You are in grace and union with the
Source and Cause of unity. Be no longer causeless. You and your Source
are one.</p>

<div class="prose">

  <p>1.14 I am no longer the personal self who was separate and alone.<br />
I am my Christ Self.<br />
I dwell in unity.<br />
My identity is certain.<br />
This is the truth. <br /><br />
I am not less than I once was, but more.<br />
Where once I was empty, I now am full.<br />
Where once I dwelt in darkness<br />
I now dwell in the light.<br />
Where once I had forgotten<br />
Now I remember who I Am.<br /><br />
Now I go forth<br />
To live as who I Am within the world<br />
To make cause and effect as one, and<br />
Union with the Source of love and all creation the reality.</p>

</div>

<p>1.15 These Dialogues are for everyone because we exist in unity with
everyone.  No one will be forced to join our conversation. Only those
listening will be ready to hear. Only those ready to hear will listen.
Remember that you cannot be taught what unity would freely give. The
goal is no longer learning.  The goal is accepting the identity that has
always been yours and that has newly been revealed and returned to your
remembrance. To “know” and not accept what you “know” to be the truth is
a continuation of the pattern of insanity that must be replaced with a
pattern of sanity.</p>

<p>1.16 Insanity is acting as if the truth is not the truth. Sanity is
accepting the truth as your reality and acting from that truth. Once the
truth has been learned, the nature of untruth remains only as an
acceptance of insanity.  What I will help you now to do is to reject
this insanity and to accept the perfect sanity of the truth.</p>

<p>1.17 This cannot be done through learning, for as you have been told,
learning was the means of the separated self’s return to unity. These
lessons have been given. They can be reviewed and reviewed again. They
can be used as continuing lessons until you feel that learning is fully
accomplished. They can serve as reminders as you continue to become the
Self you have learned that you are. But further learning is not what
will complete the transformation of the personal self to the elevated
Self. Learning will not sustain Christ-consciousness.</p>

<p>1.18 So what is it that we will now do? If I do not teach, and you do
not learn, what is our continuing means for completing this
transformation?  As you have been shown, this will not occur by means of
preparation but by means of acceptance. This will not occur by means of
trying but by means of surrender.</p>

<p>1.19 As you begin this Dialogue, questions naturally arise. You might
think that for the receiver, or transcriber, of this Dialogue, this
Dialogue may, in truth, feel like a dialogue, an exchange, a
conversation, and wonder how you, as a reader of these words, can feel
that same way. You can feel that same way by realizing that you are, as
you read these words, as much a “receiver” of this Dialogue as she who
first hears these words and transfers them to paper.</p>

<p>1.20 Is a piece of music not received by you even when you may be one of
thousands or millions who hear it? Does it matter who is first to hear
the music? This is, in truth, a dialogue between me and you. Wish not
that the “way” of the transcriber of these words were the way for
everyone, and think not that to hear “directly” from the Source is
different than what you do here. This is thinking with the mindset of
separation rather than the mindset of unity. What I say to you here, I
say to you. It matters not that I say these same words to many, for you
and the many who join you in receiving these words are one.</p>

<p>1.21 These Dialogues begin with prayer to remind you of what you have
learned in unity, a learning that has been different from all learning
you but thought you accomplished as a separated self. You have achieved
an incredible feat by allowing and accepting the state of unity even
though you could not learn how to do so. This has been the difficulty
with every curriculum that has sought to teach the truth. In order for
the truth to be truly learned, you first had to enter a state in which
this learning could occur, a state that could not be taught but only
accessed through your longing and desire.</p>

<p>1.22 You who have joined mind and heart in unity have returned to a
natural state of knowing in which learning is no longer needed. You have
now come upon a curriculum that is impossible to learn. No teacher is
available for none is needed. And yet many of you still feel what you
would describe as a need for continued learning and a continuing
relationship with a teacher who will guide you through the application
of what you have learned. You dare not, as yet, to turn to your own
heart, and trust the knowing that has been returned to you as you begin
to live in the reality of the truth.</p>

<p>1.23 This is akin to thinking of a god who exists outside or apart from
yourself. If you fully accepted your true identity, you would no longer
look outside of yourself for guidance for you would realize that your
Self is all there is.  We are one body, one Christ. We are one Self.</p>

<p>1.24 Your Self is not the person you have been since birth. Your body
does not contain you. What you are going to find happening, as you
accept your true identity, is a transference of purpose concerning your
body. What once you saw as yourself, you now must come to see only as a
representation of your Self. You are everything and everyone. All that
you see is you. You stand not separate and apart from anything.</p>

<p>1.25 We are one body.</p>

<p>1.26 Learning accepts that there are those separate from you who know
things that you know not. This is not the case. When you fully accept this,
you will see that it is true. Like the acceptance of unity that could not be
taught, but was the condition for learning, acceptance of your true identity
cannot be taught but is the condition necessary for being who you are and
the realization that learning is no longer necessary.</p>

<p>1.27 Thus we work now toward acceptance of what you have learned in unity.
We work towards your acceptance of sanity and your rejection of insanity.
We work together in love and unity for what can only be received in the love
and unity in which we truly exist together, as one body, one Christ, one Self.</p>
