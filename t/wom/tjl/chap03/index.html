<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p><span class="capital">N</span>ow, we begin.</p>

  <p>Beloved brother,<br />
for that is surely what you are,<br />
I have come because you have asked.<br />
I will share with you,<br />
during the course of our encounter of this moment,<br />
that which will reveal to you<br />
the harmony of the Kingdom.</p>

  <p>First,<br />
you will notice that I favor<br />
the use of terminology<br />
clearly Christian,<br />
though it should be seen that such terminology<br />
is better viewed as Judeo-Christian.<br />
I do this because such terms are easily identifiable<br />
relative to the time I walked among you.<br />
It is certainly not the only format<br />
which could be chosen.</p>

  <p>I am not limited,<br />
nor are you.<br />
The only difference of significance between us<br />
is that I have fully acknowledged<br />
my unlimitedness,<br />
while you choose not to.</p>

  <p>Marc,<br />
over the past few years,<br />
as you perceive the flow of your experience,<br />
much insight has been achieved<br />
for one good reason:<br />
you have desired it.<br />
Desire, then,<br />
is the first factor required<br />
in the process of emerging<br />
from the sleep you have existed within<br />
for millennia.</p>

  <p>I am quite aware<br />
of what you think is doubt.<br />
Consider this:<br />
could it be fear of the obvious?<br />
What changes would occur in your life<br />
were you to acknowledge<br />
that you,<br />
born of your desire,<br />
had indeed brought forth<br />
into manifest expression<br />
the experience of joining with the mind of Jeshua,<br />
the “Christ?”</p>

  <p>The latter term is not a title I demanded.<br />
It was placed upon Me<br />
by those who refused<br />
to fully acknowledge My message<br />
within themselves.<br />
The failure to do so<br />
is always the result of fear.</p>

  <p>Fear is the only energy<br />
which can separate you<br />
from the Kingdom.<br />
It is not the “fear of God”,<br />
but the fear of one’s own self.<br />
This is misplaced by projecting it on to God,<br />
which <strong>must</strong> be perceived<br />
as something wholly other.<br />
Contemplation of this alone<br />
can facilitate much movement<br />
within one’s consciousness.<br />
And is not all such movement<br />
but the surrender of limitation,<br />
owned as self-created?</p>

  <p>Therefore, my unlimitedness allowed Me to state,<br />
without the least hesitation:<br />
“I and My Father are One.”</p>

  <p>One enters the Kingdom<br />
when the obvious truth of this statement<br />
is acknowledged in one’s own mind.<br />
It marks the surrendering<br />
of self-imposed limitation.<br />
I wish it to be quite clear<br />
that My choice of the word<br />
“darkness” should always be equated with fear,<br />
which is the one form of energy<br />
you may be said to have created.</p>

  <p>In the Kingdom,<br />
it does not exist.<br />
You are loved wholly.<br />
You have never sinned.</p>

  <p>It is the nature of the Dreamer to<br />
believe in his Dream.<br />
The Dream you know well.<br />
The Reality you dimly perceive,<br />
like the echo of a melody<br />
faintly coming back to you.<br />
Listen to it, and it alone.</p>

  <p>This is where your special abilities are of value.<br />
Sharing with others<br />
the art of being silent<br />
can alone assist those who seek the Kingdom<br />
to come to a place of vulnerability,<br />
where we can speak to them.</p>

  <p>The Kingdom cannot be lost,<br />
but it has been forgotten.<br />
Yet in the forgetting is born the very substance<br />
of genuine remembering.</p>

  <p>We use whatever you dream<br />
as a mechanism for your awakening.<br />
If I may be allowed brief levity here,<br />
though you trudge across white carpeting<br />
with muddy feet,<br />
we transform it into an exquisite tapestry<br />
which will grab your attention.</p>

  <p>Just this is the harmony of the Kingdom:<br />
nothing, absolutely nothing,<br />
can ever serve but to nudge the Dreamer<br />
toward the end of his sleep.<br />
This is why,<br />
when I first spoke to you<br />
several months ago,<br />
I emphasized that<br />
your moment-to-moment experience<br />
is the path to your enlightenment.<br />
It is harmonious,<br />
and but a glimpse assures<br />
even the most skeptical<br />
that this is so.</p>

  <p>You will have noticed by now<br />
that your asking for contact with your guides<br />
does not require our consent<br />
for communication to occur.<br />
Your asking is your consent<br />
to allow what is always available to you.<br />
It is an exercise in the release of fear.<br />
It occurs when the Dreamer,<br />
however dimly,<br />
begins to perceive there is something quite odd<br />
about the nature of the Dream.</p>

  <p>The Dream is the entire realm of fearful experience<br />
which has burst forth from that one initial thought:<br />
“I am separate from God.”<br />
It occurred countless eons ago,<br />
yet only a moment ago,<br />
for time is but part of your Dream.</p>

  <p>One of your guides has repeatedly emphasized<br />
that the attitude one needs to adopt<br />
in order to awaken from the Dream<br />
is to “allow, allow, allow.”<br />
Asking for guidance fosters this,<br />
and is the implicit recognition<br />
that nothing else has worked,<br />
that there is nothing else to be done.</p>

  <p>Initially,<br />
this act of <strong>allowing</strong> is horrifying<br />
because it feels like dying,<br />
an experience quite well known<br />
to the separate ego!</p>

  <p>For this reason,<br />
the majority of seekers remain forever seekers,<br />
searching for some form of magic that will,<br />
in essence,<br />
bring enlightenment to them.</p>

  <p>This cannot work,<br />
for awakening requires a receptiveness.<br />
This can only occur<br />
in the attitude of allowing,<br />
that is,<br />
the allowing of death to occur.</p>

  <p>It is irrational to the separate self<br />
that the greatest doing occurs in the act<br />
of doing absolutely nothing.<br />
Therefore,<br />
“My burden is light and My yoke is easy”.</p>

  <p>No effort is required to enter the Kingdom.<br />
<strong>Allowing</strong> is the key to the doorway<br />
beyond the Dream of the Dreamer.<br />
Only a moment’s reflection will indicate<br />
how tired you, Marc,<br />
have become of your Dream.<br />
This initially can create great conflict<br />
as it dawns upon the Dreamer<br />
that something is amiss,<br />
yet his brothers perceive it not,<br />
and all attempts to share what is felt<br />
lead only to the frustration of failure.</p>

  <p>One cannot make the Dream end,<br />
because the Dreamer is part<br />
of the Dream.<br />
<strong>Allowing</strong> is the process<br />
of surrendering the Dream<br />
of the Dreamer himself.<br />
When the Dreamer dissolves,<br />
so, too, does his Dream.<br />
There is then only the Kingdom,<br />
which alone has always been.</p>

  <p>You are an awakening Dreamer.<br />
As I say this, you will recognize its truth:<br />
the only difference between you<br />
and many of our brothers<br />
is that you recognize the dream<br />
and the validity of <strong>allowing</strong><br />
as the key to the Kingdom.</p>

  <p>An aspect of your Dream<br />
was your journey with Me<br />
in Canaan and Galilee.<br />
From many sources have you been given this.<br />
Let me confirm it for you.<br />
You were an Essene,<br />
and even during this present life you have encountered<br />
many of your fellow dreamers.</p>

  <p>You have heard that you,<br />
were present when I spoke to the multitudes<br />
on the Mount of Olives.<br />
Know that you were.<br />
What struck you was not the essence<br />
of the teaching delivered that day,<br />
but the recognition that the teaching<br />
was realized in Me.<br />
The carpenter’s son had journeyed to distant lands<br />
and returned a master.<br />
Such was your perception.</p>

  <p>Thus,<br />
the doorway to the Kingdom<br />
became for you<br />
as a jewel to be discovered<br />
in the East.<br />
You went there,<br />
during nine consecutive incarnations,<br />
to master the yogas and philosophies.<br />
In this present incarnation,<br />
you have completed your chosen course.</p>

  <p>This ending, as you well know,<br />
has been the recognition<br />
that the Dreamer can master<br />
the whole of his Dream,<br />
yet remain enmeshed in the Dream itself.<br />
You have discovered the very simple key -<br />
the jewel -<br />
and is this not the silence of allowing?</p>

  <p>It can be said that your experience<br />
of My sermon<br />
was the first genuine movement<br />
to awaken from your Dream.</p>

  <p>Does it appear to have been a long journey?<br />
Remember,<br />
such a perception<br />
is of the Dream itself.</p>

  <p>I am going to ask that you begin spending<br />
a little time with Me daily now.<br />
The work I spoke of earlier<br />
is now complete<br />
and we can begin.</p>

  <p>Again,<br />
this is not a command from Me,<br />
only a gentle reminder.<br />
This participation is your free choice,<br />
as always it must be.<br />
That which I AM<br />
knows nothing of compulsion,<br />
for love cannot compel.<br />
It merely attracts the seeker of Reality<br />
to itself.</p>

  <p>This requires no effort<br />
but to be available,<br />
for each and every seeker recognizes Love<br />
because - however deeply buried -<br />
there is the recognition<br />
that Love <strong>is</strong><br />
the true being of the seeker himself.<br />
This is never denied,<br />
but it is repeatedly ignored.<br />
Our task, then,<br />
is only to gently bring the seeker<br />
to the experience of <strong>attention</strong><br />
to what alone has always been:<br />
the Kingdom.</p>

  <p>We will end here.<br />
I am well pleased with the ease you have come to<br />
in <strong>attending</strong> by <strong>allowing</strong>.</p>

  <p>Is not the journey,<br />
no matter how fraught<br />
with seeming dilemma and pain,<br />
well worth it?</p>

  <p>Bless it, all of it.</p>

  <p>Amen</p>

</p>

<p class="indent">Hello, Marc.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jeshua.”</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>Now, we begin.</p>

  <p>Is it not the comfort<br />
of absolute knowing you seek?<br />
Is it not the comfort<br />
of absolute union you desire?<br />
For it is a great truth,<br />
given earlier to you and today reinforced,<br />
that desire is the primary key to fulfillment.<br />
Therefore, one needs to assess the object of desire.<br />
For this I share with you most emphatically:<br />
what is desired is experienced,<br />
always.<br />
Such is the bounty of your Father’s table,<br />
such is the love of your universe:<br />
“Ask and ye shall receive.”</p>

  <p>I would like to clarify this statement<br />
which is, by the way, one I did make.<br />
At a future time,<br />
I will clarify for you precisely those teachings<br />
found in scripture [^1]<br />
which were given genuinely by Me;<br />
many were not.<br />
Through this process,<br />
I will clarify the meaning of those teachings,<br />
returning them to their original intention.</p>

  <p>“Ask and ye shall receive”<br />
It matters not what you ask for,<br />
nor that the asking<br />
is perhaps<br />
what is widely known as “unconscious.”<br />
The mind has depth.<br />
The asking of which I speak<br />
is that which flows<br />
from the depth of your mind.</p>

  <p>The intent of creation,<br />
which is the ever-present flow of the Father,<br />
is to utilize the asking<br />
as a mechanism for focusing that<br />
movement of life into form.<br />
The obstacle, of course,<br />
is the delusory separation known<br />
as ego.</p>

  <p>This each of you participates in,<br />
reflecting to yourselves<br />
aspects of the grand illusion<br />
which is your only creation.<br />
As all of you are of One Mind in Truth -<br />
the only begotten Son -<br />
so, too,<br />
are you of one mind as your illusion,<br />
ego.</p>

  <p>Never do you look upon another,<br />
for there is no “other”.<br />
You see only yourself.<br />
It has been spoken many times<br />
to “Love your brother as yourself.”<br />
This is because your brother is yourself.<br />
In loving your brother,<br />
you embrace all aspects of ego -<br />
your illusion -<br />
and can therefore begin to release it.<br />
Upon this crucial understanding,<br />
we may proceed to an understanding<br />
of My statement:<br />
“Ask and ye shall receive.”</p>

  <p>Because you are not separate from God,<br />
everything held in your mind as desired<br />
is manifest,<br />
and you experience it instantly.<br />
It may appear that this is not the case,<br />
but I assure you that it is.<br />
The difficulty comes<br />
when you insist on the belief<br />
that you are only this three-dimensional being<br />
you experience daily.<br />
You are far more than this,<br />
even within your grand illusion.</p>

  <p>What I am saying here<br />
is that experience need not occur<br />
in physical form to be valid.<br />
“Look upon a woman with lust<br />
and you have already committed adultery<br />
in your heart.”<br />
This should not be taken figuratively.<br />
In such a case,<br />
you have already experienced the sexual act<br />
entirely.</p>

  <p>Of course,<br />
this holds true<br />
for all desire held within the mind,<br />
from the most minute,<br />
to the most grandiose.<br />
Therefore,<br />
<strong>what</strong> you desire is of primary importance.</p>

  <p>“Seek ye first the Kingdom of God”<br />
means to seek enlightenment above all else.<br />
This does not mean<br />
that no other thoughts will be entertained.<br />
They always will be,<br />
until the ego is dissolved.<br />
However,<br />
by desiring the Kingdom,<br />
the Father -<br />
through the Holy Spirit -<br />
will transform every experience you create<br />
into the means by which you will awaken.</p>

  <p>Make no mistake about this,<br />
for when there is held as a primary desire<br />
the experience of God,<br />
it lies always beyond the limits<br />
of every ego-based desire.<br />
Thus,<br />
the impetus of your soul<br />
is to get <strong>through</strong> the limited experience,<br />
whatever it may be.</p>

  <p>It is for this reason<br />
that the seeker begins to sense<br />
that all of his experience<br />
is somehow symbolic of something<br />
which lies beyond itself.<br />
You have described this to others<br />
as a growing sense of transparency.<br />
Of course,<br />
what grows more transparent<br />
seems to be losing its<br />
meaning.<br />
Thankfully,<br />
it <strong>is</strong> losing its limited meaning,<br />
since it was conceived<br />
in the limited thought of the ego.</p>

  <p>Eventually,<br />
nothing satisfies.<br />
Now the ego is on shaky ground, for its foundation -<br />
Separation -<br />
is but the limited thought upon<br />
which the entire edifice of all your experience<br />
is based,<br />
and it, too,<br />
becomes transparent.<br />
Experientially,<br />
this is interpreted as death,<br />
and it quite literally is.</p>

  <p>To be “born again”<br />
means only that identification with ego<br />
vanishes.</p>

  <p>This is, obviously, widely misunderstood.<br />
It is always fear of one’s own death<br />
that blocks recognition of the Kingdom.</p>

  <p>For those who have been immersed<br />
in the distorted beliefs<br />
about my life’s mission upon the earth,<br />
I would offer this suggestion:<br />
Give up the hope of salvation,<br />
because you have misunderstood it.<br />
You -<br />
identified with your thought of a separate self -<br />
will not,<br />
and cannot,<br />
be saved by Me.<br />
Your desperate desire for this<br />
creates the <strong>illusion</strong> of salvation,<br />
since you always experience what you desire.<br />
But to enter the Kingdom,<br />
desire must be born of right intention.</p>

  <p>Now,<br />
“Ask and ye shall receive,”<br />
is a statement about the laser-like focus<br />
of creative energy<br />
which is the abundance<br />
of the Father’s table.</p>

  <p>Ask, therefore,<br />
not for salvation,<br />
because your ideas of it<br />
are distorted.<br />
Ask, instead,<br />
that you awaken from every last trace of belief<br />
that you have ever been separate from God.<br />
This will focus the impetus of your soul<br />
with right intention.<br />
Since you receive what you ask for,<br />
clarity of thought is essential.</p>

  <p>Marc,<br />
the thought you received<br />
concerning <strong>The Jeshua Letters</strong>
is quite valid.<br />
Allow this to come into being.<br />
Rest assured that we will be guiding this<br />
at every step.</p>

  <p>The stage of your own process<br />
could be called the “stage of allowing”.<br />
This is reached when every attempt to make,<br />
or manipulate your world,<br />
has utterly failed.<br />
Failure in your world<br />
is a blessing of the highest order,<br />
because it marks the beginning<br />
of the end of illusion.</p>

  <p>It is thus that we have shared with you<br />
that the entire array of perceptions<br />
held by the world consciousness<br />
is diametrically opposed<br />
to the Truth of the Kingdom.<br />
Failure marks the surrendering of ego,<br />
and this failure is inevitable.<br />
All perceived success<br />
stemming from the impetus of ego<br />
is temporary:<br />
failure is its only certainty.<br />
Rejoice, therefore,<br />
in the recognition of your failure.<br />
It marks the beginning<br />
of the last days of your journey<br />
to the abode of the Holy Father.</p>

  <p>Here, we will end.<br />
Go always with blessings,<br />
for you are the Son of the Father,<br />
and you are loved above all things.</p>

  <p>Amen.</p>

  November 21, 1987
</p>

<p>Events of the past few months have brought rapid changes. Changes in
relationships, changes in goals, changes in even the most basic of
perceptions. The world looks different somehow, although I cannot
describe the difference. Even though most often I seek to carry on in my
same old ways, the communications from Jeshua are clearly shifting the
sands upon which my house is built. When the foundation moves, so, too,
must everything else.</p>

<p>If only I could be alone. If only I could be undistracted for awhile,
perhaps I could make sense of it all. Perhaps whatever is happening
could be hastened to a conclusion. I picture in my mind a new place to
live a quiet, peaceful apartment, conducive to the inner work I need to
do. I choose to keep this day for myself. No work, no chores, no
errands, just… I am not sure!</p>

<p>I begin driving, with no known destination. Odd, since driving - even to
the corner store - is not high on my list of fun things to do. Feels
like a left turn here, okay, there you go, Marc, straight for awhile?
Why not? No, another left, and now that familiar shift occurs, and I
know Jeshua is present. As he speaks to me, suggesting that I go to the
mountains, I see a picture of a waterfall. I find it all a bit humorous.
I am in bumper-to-bumper traffic, listening to a thoroughly invisible
“somebody” and choosing to follow his suggestion! Don’t think I’ll tell
anyone about this for awhile.</p>

<p>Assuming that any waterfall will do, I head for Spray Falls. It is about
an hour’s drive through such world-famous cities as Buckley and
Wilkerson, the “Gateway to Mt. Rainier.” It is a place of power and
transformation for me, a place of soft beauty. At this time of year it
should not be too crowded at Mowich Lake, where the trail begins.</p>

<p>On the logging road now, I continue driving up the mountain, swerving
from side to side in an effort to miss the potholes. Suddenly, there is
a barricade in the road! Early snows must have already come to the lake.
I have several miles to go, and the damn road is closed!</p>

<p>“I knew it!” I scream at the greying sky. “I knew it was imagination!
What are you doing, Marc? It’s starting to snow, you forgot to get gas,
and you’re out here chasing chimeras!”</p>

<p>Sighing, I think to myself, “Might as well take a walk.” I hop over the
barricade, and begin walking up the road, soft snowflakes falling
through a wind-still sky, touching my cheeks and nose. I have not gone
more than twenty yards when I am stopped by a faint noise. I meander off
in its direction; it grows louder. It is the sound of rushing water. It
is the sound of a waterfall!</p>

<p>Momentarily embarrassed by my lack of faith, I quickly scramble up the
forested hillside, and as the earth levels off somewhat I begin to feel
an exhilaration. I glance at towering old-growth evergreen and cedar
trees disappearing into the white of falling snow. They are so
beautiful, and speak of power and wisdom in their majesty.</p>

<p>Now, I am there. Gentle waterfall cascading over shining rocks, becoming
a stream that meanders across soft forest soils blanketed in the velvet
of vibrant green mosses.</p>

<p>I sit on my haunches. My eyes fall on a small, delicate, snow-laden
flower, its petals barely discernible from the pure white of the
snowflakes resting upon them.</p>

<p>A feeling comes. It wells up from a place deep within, then is
transformed into words uttered not to human ears, which all too often
cannot hear, but to Life, which already knows the truth of what is
spoken:</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>We are but One. My peace I give unto you.<br />
Not as the world gives, give I unto you.</p>

</div>

<p>A joy begins to radiate out like streams of energy. It pours out of my
fingertips and down through my feet into the earth. Standing, I turn my
gaze skyward, and shout: “I and My Father <em>are</em> One!”</p>

<p>I twirl and whirl, and laugh out loud. I embrace trees and moss and
flower and open my mouth to the falling snow. I touch sacred intimacy.</p>

<p>After some time, though I haven’t any idea how long, it is as if the
trees are speaking: “Time for you to leave now.” I stroll out of the
forest, return to my truck, and begin driving down from the mountain.</p>

<p>It is said with utmost clarity, resounding through me from ears to toes
so that I turn to look, expecting Him to be setting in the
passenger-seat, even as I slam my foot on the brakes, and come to a
halt.</p>

<p class="indent">Your apartment awaits you.</p>

<p>Just as abruptly the curious feeling lets go of my cells; a liquid light
withdrawing like a wave from the shoreline. It’s again just me, sitting
in my truck on this logging road. The road ahead winds downward, leading
me back to the world, the one that seems so real, yet - if I consider
what Jeshua is teaching me - is anything real?</p>

<p>The conflict comes into my being as my mind momentarily wars with
itself, but dissolves as a whole new thought emerges: perhaps this road
leads not back into the world, but <em>through</em> it. To what?</p>

<p>My foot shifts slowly from the brakes to the gas pedal.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>Fresh from the ecstatic experience just passed, I choose to trust the
statement about my apartment, and act on it.</p>

<p>“Hi, Kendra.” We hug in the doorway, I take off my coat, and we sit down
in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Well, stranger, what have you been doing with yourself?” she asks, as we
settle into our chairs.</p>

<p>Perhaps if it were someone else, I would not share my experience in the
mountains. Thank God for this marvelous human being, who knows
everything there is to know about me, and <em>still</em> loves me! I proceed to
share with her all that transpired, especially the part about the
apartment awaiting me.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think it means?” she asks, but her smile says
something else, like: “Make your choice, Marc. Either you believe it or
you don’t.”</p>

<p>In that instant, I know my friend is prodding me, assisting me,
supporting me. Teachers are all around us, constantly.</p>

<p>“I think it doesn’t mean anything unless I live it. So let’s put it to
the test. Where is the paper? If the apartment is available, I’ll find
it there.” But I am nervous. What if it isn’t?</p>

<p>Kendra brings me the paper, then busies herself in the kitchen as I
circle ads and begin making calls on any description that sounds
remotely attractive. Several calls later, depression is beginning to set
in, or - at the very least - my old familiar doubt. I have scoured the
paper several times, quite systematically. It’s just not happening.</p>

<p>Finally, I see an ad. The apartment is close to a special neighborhood I
lived in once. The rent is much higher than I can afford. “I thinkI’ll
go take a look at this one.”</p>

<p>An hour later I am back, a little dejected. It was definitely not the
right place. Suddenly, I catch myself. No, I am not going to shrug my
shoulders, conclude I have a vivid imagination, and forget the whole
thing. It happened. I heard that voice so clearly.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>“Kendra, this is maddening. Why am I experiencing this, anyway?”</p>

<p>“They never make it easy, do they?” she answers gently, referring to
those unseen guides beyond us.</p>

<p>“Give me the paper again!” I practically rip it out of her hand and once
again turn to the classifieds. I glance down the first page, then the
second, then the third, finally the fourth. My eyes stop, my breath
stops. There is a small ad, sandwiched between two I had previously
circled and called.</p>

<p class="indent">For rent. Large one bedroom.<br />
Marine view. Available Dec. 1.</p>

<p>I cannot believe I hadn’t seen it before. It had to have been there.</p>

<p>“Hello, I’m calling about the apartment for rent.”</p>

<p>“I’m showing it at 4 p.m. The lady seems quite certain she’ll take it,
but if you want to have a look, feel free to stop by.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there. What’s the address?”</p>

<p>“Marc, you’re beaming! What’s the deal?” Kendra asks, as she hands me my
coat.</p>

<p>“The apartment is one block from the one I had in the North End after
returning from college. Same view of Commencement Bay, same peace and
quiet. My favorite place to live!”</p>

<p>“Oh, God, I’m getting those shivers again, Marc! It’s yours!”</p>

<p>For a moment my rational side resumes control. After all, I can’t just
boldly agree, can I? What if it doesn’t happen? Not quite willing to run
that risk, I respond casually: “There’s one other person to look at it
before me. I guess if she takes it, it just wasn’t meant to be.” At
least I’ve left myself an out.</p>

<p>The tilt of Kendra’s head and the look in her eyes seem to say: “You
know damn well this is it.” She’s caught me, again. What are good
friends for?</p>

<p>l arrive just as the woman looking at the apartment is coming down the
stairs. “Let me think about it, and I’ll call you tomorrow,” she
exclaims to the landlady. Seeing me, she smiles and says, “Now, don’t go
and rent it just yet, okay?”</p>

<p>I hardly see the apartment. I do not even go into the bedroom or the
bathroom. I see the view, the lights on the water, tankers resting in
the calm harbor. More importantly, I <em>feel</em> it. This is it. How about
that? It was waiting for me!</p>

  November 22, 1987
</p>

<p>It is 3 a.m; 3:22 to be exact. I am, or was, sleeping soundly. As I
begin to stir restlessly, I am further awakened by a gentle voice which,
this time, carries a sense of persistence.</p>

<p class="indent">Marc, arise and write.</p>

<p>“Shit” is my only thought. It is 3:30 in the morning, and nobody gets up
at 3:30 in the morning because some voice suggests they do so.</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>Marc, arise and write.<br />
The communication will flow<br />
with great ease at this time.</p>

</div>

<p>Okay, okay. I am, begrudgingly, awake anyway.</p>

<p>“Hmmm,” I think to myself as I sit with pen in hand, “if it’s going to
be like this I’ll have to remember to leave my glasses out.” Next time.</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>Now, we begin.</p>

  <p>Think not that you can direct the flow of your life<br />
from the viewpoint of your conscious mind.<br />
It is not designed with that capacity,<br />
for its purpose is not found there.<br />
I would ask you to fully accept<br />
that the mind is designed to be not director,<br />
but servant.</p>

  <p>A servant of what?<br />
Of the flow of your life,<br />
that mysterious movement of Life through you.<br />
It is the movement<br />
which springs forth<br />
from the Father<br />
and is to be enacted<br />
by the Son<br />
who participates in the Atonement.</p>

  <p>It cannot be controlled,<br />
for the concept of control -<br />
even the need of it -<br />
is but born after entanglement<br />
in the illusion of Separation.<br />
For what would you control<br />
but that which you distrust?</p>

  <p>Dwell upon this for a moment,<br />
and then we will continue.<br />
I would like to address<br />
your experience yesterday in the mountains<br />
which you are coming to love so dearly.<br />
First,<br />
is it not clear<br />
that you are already past the recognition<br />
that there is but one Mind?<br />
For words which the world has judged<br />
as belonging solely to Me<br />
as the only begotten of the Father<br />
poured forth from you with no sense of separation.<br />
You were, in fact,<br />
the Mind that uttered those words.</p>

  <p>To clarify:<br />
in that moment<br />
you chose to allow<br />
the true heritage of your being<br />
to be lived consciously,<br />
that level of Mind<br />
which is whole, complete,<br />
“…being of one substance with the Father.”<br />
This level is the only level<br />
that can be said to possess Reality.<br />
Anything else is illusion,<br />
born of the choice to inhere<br />
in the sheer fantasy of Separation.<br />
It is precisely this recognition<br />
to which the children of God must be directed.<br />
The Son is one Mind.<br />
It responds to the impetus of the Father’s thought,<br />
which is creative,<br />
and enacts this thought,<br />
creating in the express image of the Father.<br />
For image is the form<br />
of the Father’s holy thought.</p>

  <p>Yet I would add<br />
that what we are calling here<br />
the Father’s “holy thought”<br />
is imageless;<br />
it is but the flow of life,<br />
the matrix from which<br />
the Son draws the impetus for His work.<br />
That matrix can be described as Unconditional Love.<br />
Thus,<br />
when a mind is awakened<br />
to the truth of its identity,<br />
its creative enactment is always loving.<br />
Its creations image what the Father is,<br />
providing an opportunity for minds<br />
inhering in the bondage of illusion<br />
to witness the image of what alone is Real.<br />
When Love made visible is witnessed,<br />
it can be recognized,<br />
and a movement toward enlightenment is made,<br />
without effort.</p>

  <p>We could say<br />
that the mind is touched and for a moment -<br />
however fleeting -<br />
it recognizes the highest good available to it.<br />
For this reason<br />
is every act of love to be cherished.</p>

  <p>All minds are channels of love,<br />
to the degree that they choose to be awake.<br />
The minds of humankind<br />
are intoxicated with love.<br />
They long for love<br />
because the Truth of who they are,<br />
and what alone is Real,<br />
is necessarily within them.</p>

  <p>The awakened Son<br />
merely enacts the movement of Life,<br />
which is Love proceeding from the Father,<br />
for the benefit of those who remain asleep.<br />
The children of God are but in truth,<br />
aspects of the only begotten Son.</p>

  <p>Thus,<br />
all love enacted is self-love,<br />
for,<br />
as you have begun to recognize,<br />
we are each our brothers’ keeper<br />
because of the simple truth<br />
that we are our brother.</p>

  <p>When viewed from the illusory perspective<br />
of Separation,<br />
this is incomprehensible.<br />
When viewed from the perspective<br />
of Reality,<br />
it is the most obvious,<br />
and simplest,<br />
of facts.<br />
You comprehended quite accurately -<br />
while experiencing love<br />
in a moment’s relationship<br />
with a snow-covered flower -<br />
that when all the children of God<br />
allow themselves to utter,<br />
without a trace of resistance<br />
or self-consciousness,<br />
one simple statement,<br />
the Atonement will be completed,<br />
on earth as it is in heaven.<br />
The statement is this:<br />
“I and My Father are One”.</p>

  <p>Now, Marc,<br />
return to your sleep.<br />
But know the day when sleep will be no more,<br />
is quickly coming to the mind<br />
of the only begotten Son,<br />
as it enacts upon your beloved earth<br />
the one thought of the Holy Father.<br />
Know, too,<br />
that you are the beloved Son,<br />
“in whom I am well pleased”.<br />
You are blessed always.<br />
You need simply stretch forth your arms<br />
with palms open and uplifted,<br />
and the bounty of the Father’s table<br />
shall be bestowed upon you.<br />
It is simply the allowing<br />
of recognition to be manifested.</p>

  <p>My blessings upon you.</p>

  <p>Amen.</p>
