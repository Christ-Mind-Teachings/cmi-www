    <p class="omit"><a class="hide-review" href="/workbook/l171/#l151">Review</a></p>

<p>No-one can judge on partial evidence. That is not judgement. It is
merely an opinion based on ignorance and doubt. Its seeming certainty is
but a cloak for the uncertainty it would conceal. It needs irrational
defense because it is irrational. And its defense seems strong,
convincing, and without a doubt, because of all the doubting underneath.</p>

<p>You do not seem to doubt the world you see. You do not really question
what is shown you through the body’s eyes. Nor do you ask why you
believe it, even though you learned a long while since your senses do
deceive. That you believe them to the last detail which they report is
even stranger when you pause to recollect how frequently they have been
faulty witnesses indeed! Why would you trust them so implicitly? Why but
because of underlying doubt which you would hide with show of certainty?</p>

<p>How can you judge? Your judgement rests upon the witness that your
senses offer you. Yet witness never falser was than this. But how else do
you judge the world you see? You place pathetic faith in what your eyes
and ears report. You think your fingers touch reality and close upon the
truth. This is awareness which you understand, and think more real than
what is witnessed to by the eternal Voice of God Himself.</p>

<p>Can this be judgement? You have often been urged to refrain from
judging, not because it is a right to be withheld from you. You cannot
judge. You merely can believe the ego’s judgements, all of which are
false. It guides your senses carefully, to prove how weak you are; how
helpless and afraid, how apprehensive of just punishment, how black with
sin, how wretched in your guilt.</p>

<p>This thing it speaks of and would yet defend it tells you is yourself.
And you believe that this is so with stubborn certainty. Yet underneath
remains the hidden doubt that what it shows you as reality with such
conviction it does not believe. It is itself alone that it condemns. It
is within itself it sees the guilt. It is its own despair it sees in
you.</p>

<p>Hear not its voice. The witnesses it sends to prove to you its evil
is your own are false, and speak with certainty of what they do not
know. Your faith in them is blind because you would not share the doubts
their lord can not completely vanquish. You believe to doubt his vassals
is to doubt yourself. Yet you must learn to doubt their evidence will
clear the way to recognize yourself, and let the Voice of God alone be
Judge of what is worthy of your own belief.</p>

<p>He will not tell you that your brother should be judged by what your
eyes behold in him, nor what his body’s mouth says to your ears, nor
what your fingers’ touch reports of him. He passes by such idle
witnesses, which merely bear false witness to God’s Son. He recognizes
only what God loves, and in the holy light of what He sees do all the
ego’s dreams of what you are vanish before the splendor He beholds.</p>

<p>Let Him be Judge of what you are, for He has certainty in which there is
no doubt, because it rests on Certainty so great that doubt is
meaningless before Its face. Christ cannot doubt Himself. The Voice of
God can only honor Him, rejoicing in His perfect, everlasting
sinlessness. Whom He has judged can only laugh at guilt, unwilling now
to play with toys of sin; unheeding of the body’s witnesses before the
rapture of His holy face.</p>

<p>And thus He judges you. Accept His word of what you are, for He bears
witness to your beautiful creation, and the Mind Whose Thought created
your reality. What can the body mean to Him Who knows the glory of the
Father and the Son? What whispers of the ego can He hear? What could
convince Him that your sins are real?</p>

<p>Let Him be Judge as well of everything that seems to happen to you in
this world. His lessons will enable you to bridge the gap between
illusions and the truth. He will remove all faith that you have placed
in pain, disaster, suffering and loss. He gives you vision which can
look beyond these grim appearances, and can behold the gentle Face of
Christ in all of them. You will no longer doubt that only good can come
to you who are beloved of God, for He will judge all happenings and
teach the single lesson which they all contain.</p>

<p>He will select the elements in them which represent the truth, and
disregard those aspects which reflect but idle dreams. And He will
reinterpret all you see, and all occurrences, each circumstance, and
every happening which seems to touch on you in any way from
His one frame of reference, wholly unified and sure. And you will see
the love beyond the hate, the constancy in change, the pure in sin, and
only Heaven’s blessing on the world.</p>

<p>Such is your resurrection, for your life is not a part of anything you
see. It stands beyond the body and the world, past every witness for
unholiness, within the Holy, holy as Itself. In everyone and everything
His Voice would speak to you of nothing but your Self and your Creator,
Who is One with Him. So will you see the holy Face of Christ in
everything, and hear in everything no sound except the echo of God’s
Voice.</p>

<p>We practice wordlessly today except at the beginning of the time you
spend with God. We introduce these times with but a single, slow
repeating of the thought with which the day begins. And then we watch
our thoughts, appealing silently to Him Who sees the elements of truth
in them. Let Him evaluate each thought that comes to mind, remove the
elements of dreams, and give them back to you as clean ideas that do not
contradict the Will of God.</p>

<p>Give Him your thoughts, and He will give them back as miracles which
joyously proclaim the wholeness and the happiness God wills His Son as
proof of His eternal Love. And as each thought is thus transformed, it
takes on healing power from the Mind Which saw the truth in it, and
failed to be deceived by what was falsely added. All the threads of
fantasy are gone, and what remains is unified into a perfect Thought
that offers Its perfection everywhere.</p>

<p>Spend fifteen minutes thus when you awake, and gladly give another
fifteen more before you go to sleep. Your ministry begins as all your
thoughts are purified. So are you taught to teach the Son of God the
holy lesson of his sanctity. No-one can fail to listen, when you hear
the Voice of God give honor to God’s Son. And everyone will share the
thoughts with you which He has retranslated in your mind.</p>

<p>Such is your Eastertide. And so you lay the gift of snow-white lilies on
the world, replacing witnesses to sin and death. Through your
transfiguration is the world redeemed and joyfully released from guilt.
Now do we lift our resurrected minds in gladness and in gratitude to Him
Who has restored our sanity to us.</p>

<p>And we will hourly remember Him Who is salvation and deliverance. As we
give thanks the world unites with us and happily
accepts our holy thoughts which Heaven has corrected and made pure. Now
has our ministry begun at last, to carry round the world the joyous news
that truth has no illusions, and the peace of God, through us, belongs
to everyone.</p>
