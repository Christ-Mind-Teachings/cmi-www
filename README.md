As of March 19, 2019, The Library includes the following teachings:

* A Course In Miracles Sparkly Edition (cmi-acim)
* A Course Of Love, partially included here because it is not officially
  approved (cmi-acol)
* The Impersonal Life (cmi-jsb)
* The Raj Material (cmi-raj)
* The Way of Mastery (cmi-wom)

This is a Jekyll site and with increasing size build times became longer
and longer. As a result each teaching is developed as its own Jekyll
site with the output directed to a subdirectory, named "t", in this
sites "_site" directory.

The project is hosted by Netlify which deploys to production from Github
after a "master" branch push. A preview deploy is made from Github after
a branch, in this case "unify", push.

In both cases, production and preview deploys, we need to have the
output generated by Jekyll build in the "t" subdirectory of the this
repository.

To do this run the npm "deploy:prod" script for each of the teachings
before commiting and pushing changes to this repository. This will cause
the output from "deploy:prod" to be put in the "t" subdirectory.

The project is then committed with the output from each teaching. This
is done so the complete site will be deployed correctly by Netlify.
