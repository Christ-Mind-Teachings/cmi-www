  <div class="workbook transcript ui text container hide-pnum">
  
    <p class="lesson-header">Let me perceive forgiveness as it is.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Let us review the meaning of “forgive,” for it is apt to be
distorted and to be perceived as something which entails an unfair
sacrifice of righteous wrath, a gift unjustified and undeserved, and a
complete denial of the truth. In such a view, forgiveness must be seen
as mere eccentric folly, and this course appear to rest salvation on a
whim.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> This twisted view of what forgiveness means is easily
corrected when you can accept the fact that pardon is not asked for what
is true. It must be limited to what is false. It is irrelevant to
everything except illusions. Truth is God’s creation, and to pardon this
is meaningless. All truth belongs to Him, reflects His laws and radiates
His Love. Does this need pardon? How can you forgive the sinless and
eternally benign?</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> The major difficulty that you find in genuine forgiveness
on your part is that you still believe you must forgive the truth and
not illusions. You conceive of pardon as a vain attempt to look past
what is there; to overlook the truth in an unfounded effort to deceive
yourself by making an illusion true. This twisted viewpoint but reflects
the hold that the idea of sin retains as yet upon your mind as you
regard yourself.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Because you think your sins are real, you look on pardon as
deception. For it is impossible to think of sin as true and not believe
forgiveness is a lie. Thus is forgiveness really but a sin, like all the
rest. It says the truth is false and smiles on the corrupt as if they
were as blameless as the grass; as white as snow. It is delusional in
what it thinks it can accomplish. It would see as right the plainly
wrong, the loathsome as the good.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Pardon is no escape in such a view. It merely is a further
sign that sin is unforgivable, at best to be concealed, denied, or
called another name, for pardon is a treachery to truth. Guilt cannot be
forgiven. If you sin, your guilt is everlasting. Those who are forgiven
from the view their sins are real are pitifully mocked and twice
condemned—first by themselves for what they think they did and once
again by those who pardon them.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> It is sin’s unreality that makes forgiveness natural and
wholly sane, a deep relief to those who offer it; a quiet blessing where
it is received. It does not countenance illusions but collects them
lightly with a little laugh and gently lays them at the feet of truth.
And there they disappear entirely.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> Forgiveness is the only thing that stands for truth in the
illusions of the world. It sees their nothingness and looks right
through the thousand forms in which they may appear. It looks on lies
but it is not deceived. It does not heed the self-accusing shrieks of
sinners mad with guilt. It looks on them with quiet eyes and merely says
to them, “My brother, what you think is not the truth.”</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> The strength of pardon is its honesty, which is so
uncorrupted that it sees illusions as illusions, not as truth. It is
because of this that it becomes the undeceiver in the face of lies, the
great restorer of the simple truth. By its ability to overlook what is
not there, it opens up the way to truth, which had been blocked by
dreams of guilt.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> Now are you free to follow in the way your true forgiveness
opens up to you. For if one brother has received this gift of you, the
door is open to yourself. There is a very simple way to find the door to
true forgiveness and perceive it open wide in welcome. When you feel
that you are tempted to accuse someone of sin in any form, do not allow
your mind to dwell on what you think he did, for this is self-deception.
Ask instead, “Should I accuse myself of doing this?”</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> Thus will you see alternatives for choice in terms which
render choosing meaningful and keep your mind as free of guilt and pain
as God Himself intended it to be and as it is in truth. It is but lies
which would condemn. In truth is innocence the only thing there is.
Forgiveness stands between illusions and the truth, between the world
you see and that which lies beyond, between the hell of guilt and
Heaven’s gate.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> Across this bridge, as powerful as Love Which laid Its
blessing on it, are all dreams of evil and of hatred and attack brought
silently to truth. They are not kept to swell and bluster and to terrify
the foolish dreamer who believes in them. He has been gently wakened
from his dream by understanding what he thought he saw was never there.
And now he cannot feel that all escape has been denied to him.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> He does not have to fight to save himself. He does not
have to kill the dragons which he thought pursued him. Nor need he erect
the heavy walls of stone and iron doors he thought would make him safe.
He can remove the ponderous and useless armor made to chain his mind to
fear and misery. His step is light, and as he lifts his foot to stride
ahead, a star is left behind to point the way to those who follow him.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> Forgiveness must be practiced, for the world cannot
perceive its meaning nor provide a guide to teach you its beneficence.
There is no thought in all the world which leads to any understanding of
the laws it follows nor the thought which it reflects. It is as alien to
the world as is your own reality. And yet it joins your mind with the
reality in you.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup> Today we practice true forgiveness that the time of
joining be no more delayed. For we would meet with our reality in
freedom and in peace. Our practicing becomes the footsteps lightening up
the way for all our brothers, who will follow us to the reality we share
with them.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup> That this may be accomplished, let us give a quarter of an
hour twice today and spend it with the Guide Who understands the meaning
of forgiveness and was sent to us to teach it. Let us ask of Him:</p>

<p><sup>16</sup> <em>Let me perceive forgiveness as it is</em>.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup> Then choose one brother as He will direct, and catalogue
his “sins,” as one by one they cross your mind. Be certain not to dwell
on any one of them, but realize that you are using his “offenses” but to
save the world from all ideas of sin. Briefly consider all the evil
things you thought of him, and each time ask yourself “Would I condemn
myself for doing this?”</p>

<p><sup>18</sup> Let him be freed from all the thoughts you had of sin in
him. And now you are prepared for freedom. If you have been practicing
thus far in willingness and honesty, you will begin to sense a lifting
up, a lightening of weight across your chest, a deep and certain feeling
of relief. The time remaining should be given to experiencing the escape
from all the heavy chains you sought to lay upon your brother which were
laid upon yourself.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup> Forgiveness should be practiced through the day, for there
will be so many times when you forget its meaning and attack yourself.
When this occurs, allow your mind to see through this illusion as you
tell yourself:</p>

<p><sup>20</sup> <em>Let me perceive forgiveness as it is.<br />
Should I accuse myself of doing this?<br />
I will not lay this chain upon myself</em>.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup> In everything you do, remember this:</p>

<p><sup>22</sup> <em>No one is crucified alone, and yet<br />
No one can enter Heaven by himself</em>.</p>
