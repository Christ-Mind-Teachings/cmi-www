    <p>1.1 Let me tell you what this Treatise will not be about. It will not be
predictive. It will leave no one out. It will not appeal to fear nor
give you cause for fear. It will not be about tools or tell you that
some have the tools for accomplishment and that others do not. It will
continue the view from within the embrace, an embrace and a view that is
inclusive of all.</p>

<p>1.2 It will, however, be conclusive. It will separate truth from
illusion in ways that will make some uncomfortable. It will continue to
challenge your former ideas and beliefs as have the previous Treatises.
But it will do this only to reach a conclusion of certainty from which
you can live.</p>

<p>1.3 In doing so, it may seem to you as if some will be left out and as
if you are being told that you can achieve what many others have tried
and failed to achieve. These are the types of ideas that will cause
discomfort to many of you as you still find it hard to believe in your
own worthiness, and particularly in your own chosenness. It is this idea
of being chosen that will cause your mind to conclude that some are not
chosen now and that many were not chosen in the past.</p>

<p>1.4 Can you choose what is unavailable for choosing? Can you choose to
own another’s property? Take another’s husband or wife? Choosing is not
taking. Choosing implies relationship. Just as there are answers to
choose between on a test, some of them correct and some of them
incorrect, there are some answers that are not offered to be chosen
because they do not relate to the question. All of the commandments and
all of the beliefs of all of the world’s religions are but related to
this idea of choosing, a process of the free will with which you all are
endowed.</p>

<p>1.5 A question has been asked and a response is awaited. Are you willing
to be chosen? Are you willing to be the chosen of God? All are asked.
What is your answer?</p>

<p>1.6 Why, you might ask, is a word such as chosen used, when many other
words would do, and when the concept of being chosen is one laden with
so many false ideas about exclusivity? I am using this word specifically
because of the precedent of its use historically. Many different groups
believe they are the chosen people of God, or Buddha, or Muhammad. Many
of this generation believe they are a chosen generation. Neither way of
thinking is wrong. All are chosen.</p>

<p>1.7 An elementary example might be useful. In many countries, all are
given the opportunity to go to school. This might be as easily stated as
all are chosen for schooling. Some might look at this as lack of choice,
saying that anything that is mandatory allows no room for choice. In
their rebellion against the mandatory nature of their chosenness or
opportunity, they might easily choose not to learn. The nature of life,
however, is one of learning, and if they do not learn what is taught in
school, they will, by default, learn what is not taught in school. If
you can consider this example with no judgment, you can see it simply as
a choice.</p>

<p>1.8 As is clearly being seen amid many school systems in the current
time, the choice to not learn what is taught in school, when taken up by
many, becomes a crisis in education that calls for education to change.
It may signal that what is taught is no longer relevant, or that the
means of teaching what is relevant no longer works. It may be a choice
made regarding means or content, a choice made from fear or made from
love. But there is, in other words, no lack of choice. A choice is
always made. A choice to accept or reject, say yes or say no, to learn
this or to learn that, to learn now or to learn later.</p>

<p>1.9 There but seems to be a difference in the “educated” choice and the
“uneducated” choice. Many of you may look back on choices that you made
and say, “I would have chosen differently if I had but known” this or
that.  The choice is the way of coming to know. No choice is not such.
No choice ever excludes anyone from coming to know his or her chosen
lesson.</p>

<p>1.10 This curriculum is mandatory and so some have rebelled and will
rebel against it. Those who do not choose to learn from the curriculum,
will, like school children, learn through what is not of the curriculum
because they have chosen another means of learning. Means is what is
being spoken of here. But all means are for one end. All will learn the
same content, for all are chosen; and all learning, no matter what the
means, will eventually lead them to the truth of who they are.</p>

<p>1.11 The choice that lies before you now concerns what it is you would
come to know. The question asked throughout this Course is if you are
willing to make the choice to come to know your Self and God now. This
is the same as being asked if you are willing to be the chosen of God.
This is the same question that has been asked throughout the existence
of time. Some have chosen to come to know themselves and God directly.
Others have chosen to come to know themselves and God indirectly. These
are the only two choices, the choices between truth and illusion, fear
and love, unity and separation, now and later. What you must understand
is that all choices will lead to knowledge of Self and God, as no
choices are offered that are not such. All are chosen and so it could
not be otherwise. But at the same time, it must be seen that your choice
matters in time, even if all will make the same choice eventually.</p>

<p>1.12 As was said within “A Treatise on the Personal Self,” even the
house of illusion is held within the embrace of love, of God, of the
truth. Does this sound exclusive to you? The embrace is inclusive. All
are chosen.</p>

<p>1.13 And yet, as many of you have come instinctively to feel, something
is different now. You are beginning to become excited by the feeling
that something different is possible; that you might just be able to
achieve what others have not; that this time might just be different
than any other time. Even as you begin to tentatively let this
excitement grow, your loyalty to your race, species, and the past,
hinders your excitement. If what you are beginning to believe might be
possible is possible, and has been possible, are you to look on all of
those who have come before you as failures? Has the seed of the future
lain dormant in the past? Could it have been activated hundreds or
thousands of years ago, by countless souls more worthy than you, and
ushered in the time of heaven on earth and the end of suffering long
ago?  Could many have been spared who weren’t? How capricious this must
seem in your imaginings. What a fickle universe. What a perverse God. If
an end to suffering and fear has been possible, and is possible, why has
it not come to be? Why has it not been known? What could possibly make
you believe it could come to be now when it didn’t come to be before?</p>

<p>1.14 The only answer might seem to lie in the laws of evolution, the
slow learning and adaptive process of man. Surely this would seem a
likely answer and one to assuage your guilt and uncertainty, your fear
of believing in yourself and in this time as the time to end all time.
There must be something different about this time, the capabilities of
those existing within it.  It must be your science or technology, your
advanced mental abilities, or even your leisure time that has opened up
this opportunity. The only alternative would seem to be that this must
be simply the chosen time and you the chosen people. If the chosen time
had been two thousand years ago, life would have been different since
then. If Jesus Christ were the chosen one, his life would have changed
the world. If the Israelites were the chosen people, so much calamity
would not have befallen them. And so the idea of choice rears its head
again and wraps the simple statement that All Are Chosen in confusion.</p>

<p>1.15 This confusion is what this Treatise will seek to dispel so that
you are left with no confusion and only certainty. The only thing that
will dispel this confusion and bring you the certainty that is needed to
create the new world is an understanding of creation and your role
within it, both as Creators and Created.</p>

<p>1.16 As was said within “A Treatise on the Personal Self,” all notions
of blame must be gone from you. Thus, you are asked not to look back
with blame, for no such cause for blame exists. No cause to look back
exists at all, for the truth exists in the present. This is the same as
saying the truth exists within you. It is in this way that time is not
real and will no longer be real to you as you come to live by the truth.
It is in this way that the truth of the past still lives and that the
illusion of the past never was.</p>

<p>1.17 The difference between this time and the time that has but seemed
to have gone before has already been stated as the difference between
the time of the Holy Spirit and the time of Christ. This has also been
restated as the difference between the time of learning through contrast
and the time of learning through observation. It is further stated here
as the difference between learning by contrast and indirect
communication and learning through observation and direction
communication or experience. The same truth has always existed, but the
choice of a means of coming to know the truth has shifted. All were
chosen and all are chosen.</p>

<p>1.18 You have completed God’s act of choosing you by choosing God. This
is all the chosen people are in time—those who have chosen God as God
has chosen them. That you have chosen God and chosen a new means of
coming to know the truth—the means of Christ-consciousness, is what has
ushered in the new time.</p>

<p>1.19 Many came to know the truth by indirect means and shared what they
came to know through similarly indirect means. This is the nature of
learning and of sharing in relationship. Means and end are one. Cause
and effect are the same. It is these indirect means of communicating the
truth that have led to your advances in science and technology, and to
the refinement of your minds, hearts and senses, not the reverse. Your
ancestors have done you a great service. With the means they had
available—in the chosen means of a chosen consciousness united in
oneness with the Holy Spirit— they passed on, indirectly, all that they
came to know. This indirect means of communication is the reason for the
existence of churches, and these means too have served you well.</p>

<p>1.20 But these indirect means of communication left much open to
interpretation. Different interpretations of indirectly received truth
resulted in different religions and varying sets of beliefs that, in the
way of the time— the way of learning through contrast—provided contrast
through dissent.  The good in which one believed became the evil that
another fought and in the contrast learning did occur and has continued
to occur even unto this time. You have learned much of the nature of the
truth by seeing what you have perceived as the contrast between good and
evil.</p>

<p>1.21 It is the truth that you have now learned all that can be learned
from this state of consciousness and that you have given your
willingness to learn in a new way. The new way is here. If you are now
to learn directly, you are also now to share directly. This is the way
of learning in relationship. Means and end are one. Cause and effect are
the same.</p>

<p>1.22 You have felt this shift coming and so has the world. This is the
yearning we have spoken of as the proof of love’s existence and of your
existence in a state of unity rather than a state of separation. This
yearning called you to the limits of the state of consciousness that was
the time of the Holy Spirit. This limit acted upon you as a catalyst to
create desire for the new. It is what has caused your growing impatience
with the personal self, with acquiring all that your new learning in
science and technology but seemed to offer. It is what has caused your
growing desire for meaning and purpose. It is what has caused you to
finally be ready to still your fear, a fear that once prevented the
direct and observable learning that now is available to you.</p>

<p>1.23 While the state of the world and the people within it may not
outwardly seem much changed from the world of your ancestors despite the
advances of learning that have taken place, it is a different world. You
have not known the secret yearning in the hearts of your brothers and
sisters, nor have you known that it matched your own. You may have seen
the acts that this yearning has driven them to and thought, incorrectly,
that the new time that is here is the end of the days of innocence. You
may have thought it advantageous to have once been so clearly able to
see the contrast between good and evil and feel now as if these
distinctions have become more and more obscure. Some have yearned for a
return to days not long past, days during which distinctions between
right and wrong did seem to be more certain. But the very blurring of
these edges have been the forerunners, the signs of the shift in
consciousness that is occurring.</p>

<p>1.24 All across the world, people of the world have been demanding to
learn directly, through experience, and saying “no more” to the lessons
of the intermediaries. What has grown in you has grown in your children
and they are not only ready, but also demanding to learn through
observation and direct communication or experience. Many not yet grown
to maturity have been born into the time of Christ, and do not fit
within the time or the consciousness of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>1.25 For a short time, an overlap is occurring during which those unable
to allow themselves to become aware of the new state of consciousness
are resisting it, again indirectly. Some occupy themselves with mind and
spirit numbing activities in order to block it out, having chosen to die
within the state of consciousness in which they have lived. Others do
not wish to experience the truth directly, but only to experience
experience. They are in the desperate throes of wanting to experience
everything before they allow themselves to directly experience the
truth, thinking still that the experience of the truth will exclude much
that they would want to try before they give into its pull and settle
there. But all have become aware that a new experience awaits and that
they stand at the threshold of choice.</p>

<p>1.26 Those born into the time of Christ will settle for nothing less
than the truth and will soon begin looking earnestly for it. Even the
ego-self will be perceived clearly by these, and they will not want it
for their identity but only will accept it until another identity is
offered.</p>

<p>1.27 Let me repeat that during the time of the Holy Spirit, some were
able to come to know themselves and God through the indirect means of
this state of consciousness and to pass on what they learned through
indirect means.  Fewer were able to achieve a state of consciousness in
which direct communication was possible, to come to know themselves and
God directly, and to pass on this learning through direct means. What I
am saying is that it is not impossible for those who remain unaware of
the new consciousness to come to know themselves and God, and to
continue to pass their learning on indirectly, or through indirect
communication and contrast. But this also means that the great majority
will become aware of the new state of consciousness and that learning
will pass through them directly through observation and direct
communication or experience. It means that the last generation born into
the time of the Holy Spirit will live out their lives and that soon all
who remain on earth will be those born into the time of Christ.</p>

<p>1.28 This is the truth of the state of the world in which you exist
today.</p>
