    Jeshua has given the following suggestions about how to
    “listen” to the recordings or transcripts of these Lessons.
  </p>
  <ol class="ui list">
    <li>
      Select a separate 'Way of' notebook with a cover that has meaning
      for you, and a pen that you love; use them only for this work. Keep your
      notebook in a sacred space (such as on your altar) wherever you live.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always settle down, relax and allow the breath to flow deeply and
      fully before you start listening to the recordings or reading the
      transcripts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow the words to simply land within you, without any effort to
      understand all of this information at once.
    </li>
    <li>
      Notice which passages cause feelings to arise within your being.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make selective notes and identify in your 'Way of' notebook those
      passages which touch your feeling nature.
    </li>
    <li>
      Later (or on a different day) copy the passages from your notebook
      which elicited a strong feeling. Write them several times on a separate
      sheet of paper in a state of innocence and playfulness.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whenever a question is asked it is useful to pause and reflect on
      it, before moving on.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    These Lessons were first given with the intention of each being lived
    with, and deeply absorbed, for at least thirty days. In reality you will
    find that each Lesson keeps teaching you, and taking you further into
    your own spiritual awakening!
  </p>

  <p>
    Listen to each recording or read the Lesson several times in different
    locations at different times of the day. Stay with each Lesson until you
    feel complete with it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Doing the exercises as given is also very important. Many of these
    exercises are the same ones that were given to Jeshua by his Essene
    elders over 2000 years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feel free to use these suggestions as you wish, but most of all have fun
    with the material.
