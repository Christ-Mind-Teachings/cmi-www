    <p>Whether or not you have gotten any clear grasp of what has just been
stated, do not discard it as impossible of comprehension. For in every
line is hidden a meaning that will more than repay you for the study
necessary to make it become clear.</p>

<p>This Message is to awaken you to a realization of what You are, to a
realization of your real Self. It is intended to make you once more
conscious of Me, your Divine Self, so conscious that never again will
you be deceived by that other self, which you have imagined as being you
and which so long has lured you on by feeding you with its unsatisfying
sense pleasures, its mental dissipations and emotional delights.</p>

<p>Before that can be it will be necessary for you thoroughly to know
that supposed other self, that self which You created by thinking it
real and separate from Me, and then kept alive by giving it the power
thus to entice and deceive you; yes, that self-created self, with its
purely selfish pride and ambitions and imagined power, its love of
life, of possessions, of being thought wise or good, – but which self
is merely your human personality, which was born only to die as a
separate identity, and as such has no more reality or permanence that
the leaf, the snow or the cloud.</p>

<p>Yes, you will be brought face to face with that petty personal self,
and will see with perfect vision all its sordid selfishness and human
vanities; and you will then learn – if you but turn to Me and ask in
simple faith and trust – that it is I, the Infinite, Impersonal part
of You, abiding always within, Who am thus pointing out to you all
these illusions of the personality, which for so many ages have
separated you in consciousness from Me, Your glorious, Divine Self.</p>

<p>This realization will surely come, when you can recognize that this
Message is from Me, and when you have determined that it shall be. To
you, whom I have inspired with such a determination, I will cause
every illusion in time to disappear, and you shall in truth know Me.</p>

<p>The exercise of your mind along these abstract lines will not hurt
you. Instead it is what your mind needs. For, not until you can grasp
My Meaning when presented to you in ideas such as there herein
contained, coming from without, can you perceive and correctly
interpret My Idea when I inspire you from within. Your mind I AM thus
preparing for USE, not to gain more Earthly knowledge, but in order
that you can receive and give forth My Heavenly Knowledge to those
whom I shall bring to you for that purpose.</p>

<p>With a prayer to Me, Your Own Real Self, your Father-in-Heaven, that
true realization may come, read carefully what follows.</p>

<p>We have arrived, in the course of our consideration of the process of
unfoldment of My Idea, to where the I AM of you, manifesting in your
Immortal Soul Body, or in the Thought Image created by My Thinking, is
now ready to take on a substantial form, a form suitable for the Earth
expression of My Attributes.</p>

<p>This change from a mental to a mortal form took place after the manner
and process of all thinking and creating, and is literally described
in the Bible, where it says I “formed man of the dust of the ground,
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a
living soul.”</p>

<p>Shall I explain further? That the quickening power within My Idea
(your Soul) proceeded to attract to it the various elements of life
substance (dust), and, atom by atom, and cell by cell, in due course of
time, to mold and shape each into substantial reality, after the pattern
of the Thought Image composing your Soul Body, thus forming an Earthly
outer covering, as it were, until finally your mortal form actually
became manifest to the psychic sense, if not yet to what is called the
physical sense. Whereupon, all being now prepared for this cyclic
moment, You, My Attribute, breathed into and then through its nostrils
(from within) the breath of life, and You then made your first
appearance of Earth as a human being – a living Soul (My Idea now able
to express consciously through a suitable Earth medium), containing
within your Self all of My Attributes, all of My Powers and all of My
Possibilities.</p>

<p>Thus were now manifest all the various mediums for the Earth expression
of My Idea; and You, being one of My Attributes, naturally had dominion
over all of these mediums, or possessed the power of utilizing any or
all of them, if necessary, for the full and complete expression of Your
– My Attributes – powers and possibilities.</p>

<p>In this manner and for this reason alone did You and Your Brothers and
Sisters come into human expression. While in human form yet Your
expression was so entirely Impersonal, that, though self-conscious,
you still looked wholly to Me within for inspiration and guidance.</p>

<p>This, then, was the first condition into which You awakened when You
entered into Earth expression, and is what is called the Edenic state
or dwelling in the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>This Edenic state represents the Celestial phase of Impersonal
Consciousness, or that state in which You were still consciously One
with Me, though now confined in a mortal medium of expression.</p>

<p>Now, I shall not tell you in detail how or why it became necessary for
Me to “drive” You (now manifesting as Man or Humanity) out of the Garden
of Eden, other than to remind you of the part that Desire plays in Earth
expression, and its relation to My Will; how it centers your interest in
outer things and makes you forget Me within.</p>

<p>When you have solved that and comprehended somewhat of My reason, then
perhaps you can understand the necessity of first causing You (Humanity)
to fall into a deep sleep (You having arrived at the close of another
Cycle called a Cosmic day), and of letting you dream you had awakened,
but in reality you were and are still asleep, and everything from that
day to this, including all seeming Earthly events and conditions, have
been but a Dream, from which you will fully awaken only when You
(Humanity) again become wholly conscious of Me within, and of finding
Yourself (Humanity) no longer outwardly one, but two; one an active,
thinking, aggressive part, thereafter called a man, and the other a
passive, feeling, receptive part, a womb-man, or woman;</p>

<p>Also the necessity of these seeming Earth influences being brought to
bear to draw Your consciousness from purely Celestial delights and to
hold it in this new Dream condition, in order to develop a mortal
mind, that You might through its natural selfish tendencies become
centered entirely upon Your Earthly mission of mortal expression;</p>

<p>And the wisdom of having this influence, through the Serpent of
Selfishness (the shape I caused it to assume in your mind), first
generate in the passive, feeling, receptive part of You – Desire, the
mortal agent of My Will, which was to supply the motives and the power
for the further and complete expression of My Attributes on Earth;</p>

<p>And finally the necessity of Desire casting its complete spell over
You (Humanity), that Your Celestial or Impersonal nature might be kept
deep in sleep; until, in your Dream, by the free but ignorant use of
My Will, You could taste and fully eat of the fruit of the so-called
Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and through the eating could learn
properly to discriminate and know its fruit for what it really is; and
thus acquire the strength to use the knowledge thus gained wisely and
perfectly in the expression of My Idea only.</p>

<p>You likewise possibly now can understand how in your Dream you became
more and more engrossed in and attached to this false Earth state,
through first eating of this fruit and learning to know Good and Evil,
and after learning of the new and enticing world thus opened up to
you, dying to the knowledge of the Reality back of it all; and how and
why it was You learned that You were naked – both the thinking and
the feeling parts of You; and also why you grew afraid and tried to
hide from Me, thus creating in your consciousness the sense of
separation from Me.</p>

<p>Now, perhaps, you can see why this all had to be, why You (Humanity) had
to leave the Edenic state of Impersonal Consciousness and lose Your Self
wholly in the Earth illusions of this Dream World, in order to be able
to create a body and develop in it a personal or self consciousness
capable of fully expressing My Perfection.</p>

<p>Thus was born Your human personality, and since its birth have I
impelled You to nourish, support and strengthen it, by filling You
with longings, hopes, ambitions, and aspirations, with all the various
manifestations of Desire; which are but the human phases of My Will,
operating in the preparation and development of a medium capable of
expressing perfectly My Attributes on Earth.</p>

<p>And so I Spake the Word, and drove You out of the Garden of Eden, and
clothed You with a “coat of skin,” or, in other words, with flesh, the
same as other animals. For now, in order that You might enter into the
heart of Earth conditions, into the real Earth, the Earth of My Idea,
not the one of your Dream, so as to quicken My Idea therein into
active life expression, You, My Attribute, had to have an organism and
a covering appropriate to the conditions in which You were to manifest in your Dream.</p>

<p>Likewise, in thus giving You a coat of skin, did I, by so doing,
provide My Idea with a suitable form for Earthly expression, I gave
you the power to express Your Self, through a definite organism, by
means of words.</p>

<p>In the Impersonal there is no use or necessity for words. Ideas alone
exist and express. They simply Are, for they are the expression of the
various phases of My Be-ing.</p>

<p>But in this Dream condition, where every expression in these early
stages of outer being had to have a form and substance that could be
heard, seen, felt, smelled or tasted, in order that its meaning could
be clearly apprehended, there naturally had to be provided organisms
capable of being used for the double purpose of expression and of
understanding what was expressed.</p>

<p>As My Idea unfolded Itself, after Your expulsion from Eden, You – one
of My Divine Attributes, dwelling within My Idea of that Attribute in
expression, in turn dwelling within the Thought Image of My Self, and
finally manifesting outwardly in the Earth form of Words, when
impelled by My Will in the guise of Desire to express My Meaning –
began rapidly to “increase and multiply.”</p>

<p>In Your search for the most favorable conditions for the manifestation
of Your particular attributes, You gradually spread over the face of
the Earth, each containing many words, and all born of Desire in the
human mind to express in Earthly terms the infinite phases of My Idea
ever surging within.</p>

<p>The more the human mind strove thus to express “in Words” My Idea,
the greater and more abject the failure.</p>

<p>In time will the Great Awakening come, that all Words are but Symbols of
One Idea, and all Ideas of whatsoever nature are but phases of One Idea,
My Idea of My Self in Expression, and that all Desire to express in
Words that Idea, without the consciousness of My Will being the One and
Only source of Inspiration, is futile. Likewise, all desire to express
that Idea in living acts, without losing all consciousness of your human
personality – of your personal part in the acts, and centering your
self wholly in Me, is vain and fruitless and will end only in
failure, disappointment and humiliation.</p>
