    <p>Now I have purposely not stated clearly all the how and why of these
things; for I have reserved for you, when you call upon Me so to do,
and are capable of receiving it, an inspiration from within with a far
more comprehensive vision of the unfoldment and development of My
Divine Idea, and Its final perfected expression, than is herein
pictured.</p>

<p>If I were here to tell the real meaning of My many manifestations,
before you were consciously capable of experiencing its Truth, you
neither would believe My words, nor could you comprehend their inner
application and use.</p>

<p>Therefore, as I begin to awaken in you a realization that I AM within,
and more and more cause your human consciousness to become an
Impersonal channel through which I can express, will I gradually
reveal to you the Reality of My Idea, dissipating one by one the
illusions of the ages which have hidden Me from you, enabling Me
thereby to manifest through you My Heavenly Attributes of Earth in all
their humanly Divine perfection.</p>

<p>I have herein given you but a glimpse of My Reality, but just to the
extent that that which has been revealed becomes clear will more be
opened up unto you from within, and far more wonderful than this now
seems to you.</p>

<p>For My Idea within, when It finally and completely shines through Its
mantle of flesh, will compel you to worship and glorify Me far above
all that your human mind and intellect now conceive of as God.</p>

<p>Before you can become conscious of all this and can truly comprehend
it, you and your human personality must make it possible for Me to
reveal it, by turning within to Me as the One and Only Source,
bringing to Me your measure absolutely empty of self, and with mind
and heart as simple and trusting as those of a child.</p>

<p>Then and then only, when nothing of the personal consciousness remains
to prevent My filling you full to overflowing with the consciousness
of Me, can I point out to you the glories of My Real Meaning, for
which this whole Message is but the outer preparation.</p>

<p>The time has now arrived, however, for you to comprehend somewhat of
this. Enough has been revealed to prepare you for the recognition of
My Voice speaking within.</p>

<p>Therefore, I shall now proceed as if you realize I AM within, and that
these Truths which I voice through the medium of these pages are but
to impress more strongly upon your consciousness those phases of My
Idea which you could not clearly receive direct.</p>

<p>That which herein appeals to you as Truth is consequently but a
confirmation of that which My Idea has heretofore been struggling to
express from within.</p>

<p>That which does not appeal and which you do not recognize as your own,
pass by, for that means I do not desire you to receive it as yet.</p>

<p>But each Truth I voice herein will go on vibrating until It reaches
the minds I have quickened to receive It; for every word is filled
with the potent power of My Idea, and to minds that perceive the Truth
hidden therein this Truth becomes a living Reality, being that phase
of My Idea they are now worthy and capable of expressing.</p>

<p>As all minds are but phases of My Infinite Mind, or parts of It
manifesting in different forms of mortal nature, when I speak through
the medium of these pages to your mind and to other minds, I AM but
speaking to My mortal Self, thinking with My Infinite Mind, pushing
forth My Idea into Earthly expression.</p>

<p>Just so will You soon be thinking My Thoughts, and be conscious that I
AM speaking within directly to your human consciousness, and you will
then no longer have to come to this or to any other of My outer
Revelations, either spoken or written, in order to perceive My
Meaning.</p>

<p>For AM I not within You, and AM I not You, and are You not One with
Me, Who live in and express through the consciousness of all minds,
knowing all things?</p>

<p>All that remains for you to do is to enter into the All-consciousness
of My Mind and abide there with Me, even as I abide within My Idea in
Your Mind. Then all things shall be Yours, as they now are Mine, being
but the outer expression of My Idea, and existing only by reason of
the consciousness I gave them when I thought them into being.</p>

<p>It is all a matter of consciousness – of your conscious thinking. You
are separated from Me only because you think you are. Your mind is but
a focal point of My Mind. If you but knew it, what you call your
consciousness is My Consciousness. You cannot even think, much less
breathe or exist without My Consciousness being in you, can you not
see it?</p>

<p>Well, then, think, believe you are I, that We are not separated, that We
could not possibly be separated; for WE are ONE, I within You, and You
within Me, Think this is so; determinedly image it as so; and verily the
moment you are conscious of this, that moment are you with Me in Heaven.</p>

<p>You are what you believe you are. Not one thing in your life is Real or
has any value to you only as your thinking and believing has made it
such.</p>

<p>Therefore, think no more you are separated from Me, and abide with Me
in the Impersonal Realm, where all Power, all Wisdom, and all Love,
the threefold nature of My Idea, but await expression through You.</p>

<p>Now I have spoken much of this, and have apparently said the same thing
more than once, but in different words. I have done this purposely,
presenting My Meaning in different lights, that you might finally be
brought to comprehend My Divine Impersonality, which is in Reality Your
Impersonality.</p>

<p>Yes, I have repeated and will continue to repeat many Truths, and you
may think it tedious and unnecessary; but if you will read carefully
you will find that each time I repeat a Truth I always add something
to what has already been said, and that each time a stronger and more
lasting impression is made upon your mind.</p>

<p>This done, My purpose has been accomplished, and you will soon come into
a Soul realization of that Truth.</p>

<p>If you receive not such impression and still think such repetition a
useless waste of words and time, know that your intellect only is
reading, and that My real meaning has altogether escaped you.</p>

<p>You, however, who do comprehend, will love every word, and will read and
re-read many times, and consequently will receive all the wondrous
Pearls of Wisdom I have held in reserve for you.</p>

<p>These words and their message will be to you hereafter merely a fount
of inspiration, or a door through which you will be enabled to enter
into the Impersonal estate and to hold sweet communion with Me, your
Father in Heaven, when I will teach you all things you desire to know.</p>

<p>I have been picturing the Impersonal estate from many viewpoints, in
order that it may become so familiar that you can unerringly
distinguish it from all inferior states, and may learn to dwell
consciously in it at will.</p>

<p>When you can consciously dwell in it so that My Words when and
wherever spoken can always find lodgment and understanding in your
mind, then will I permit you to use certain faculties I have been
awakening in you. These faculties will enable you more and more
clearly to see the Reality of things, not only the beautiful and
lovely qualities in the personalities of those about you, but their
weaknesses, faults and shortcomings, as well.</p>

<p>But the reason you are enabled to see these faults and shortcomings,
is not that you may criticize or judge your brother, but that I may
arouse in you a definite resolve to overcome such faults and
shortcomings in your own personality. For, mark you! You would take
no note of them in others were they not still in your self; for I
within, then would not need to call them to your attention.</p>

<p>As all things are for use, and use only, let us study the use you have
hitherto made of other faculties, gifts and powers I have given you.</p>

<p>You must realize by this time I have allowed you all things. All you
have, or are, be it of good or evil, of blessing or suffering, of
success or failure, of riches or lack, I have allowed you or attracted
to you. Why? For USE in awakening you to a recognition and
acknowledgment of Me as The Giver.</p>

<p>You could not honestly acknowledge Me as such until you knew I AM, The
Giver. Your personality, in fact, had become so engrossed in trying to
get rid of or to exchange many of the things I had given you for other
things you thought were better, that of course you could not even dream,
much less acknowledge, Me, Your Own Self, as The Giver.</p>

<p>Possibly you do now acknowledge Me as The Giver, as the Inner Essence
and Creator of all things in your world and in your life, even of your
present attitude toward these things.</p>

<p>Both are My doing, for they are but the outer phases of the process I
AM using in the expression of My Idea of your inner Perfection, which
Perfection being My Perfection is gradually unfolding from within you.</p>

<p>As you more and more realize this, will the true meaning and use of
the things, conditions and experiences I send be revealed unto you.
For you will then begin to glimpse My Idea within, and when you
glimpse that Idea will you begin to know Me – your own Real Self.</p>

<p>Before you can truly know Me, however, you must learn that all things
I give you are Good and that they are for use, My use, and that
you personally have no interest in or actual right to them, and they
are of no real benefit to you, only as you put them to such use.</p>

<p>I may be expressing through you beautiful symphonies of sound, color
or language, that manifest as music, art or poetry, according to human
terminology, and which so affect others as to cause them to acclaim
you as one of the great ones of the day.</p>

<p>I may be speaking through your mouth or inspiring you to write many
beautiful Truths, which may be attracting to you many followers, who
hail you as a most wonderful preacher or teacher.</p>

<p>I may even be healing through you diverse diseases, casting out
devils, making the blind to see and the lame to walk, and performing
other marvelous works which the world calls miracles.</p>

<p>Yes, all these I may be doing through you, but of absolutely no benefit
is any of it to you personally, unless you use and apply these harmonies
of sound in your every spoken word, so that to all hearers they will
seem as the sweet music of heaven; and unless your sense of color and
proportion so manifests in your life that only kind, uplifting, helpful
thoughts flow from you, proving that the only true art is that of seeing
clearly My Perfection in all My human expressions, and of allowing the
quickening power of My Love to pour through you into their heart,
picturing to their inner vision My Image hidden therein.</p>

<p>Likewise no credit attaches to you, no matter what wonderful Truths I
speak or works I perform through you, unless you, yourself, live these
Truths, daily, hourly; and make these works serve as a constant reminder
of Me and My Power, which I ever pour out freely for you, My Beloved,
and for all, to use in My Service.</p>

<p>You, to whom I have apparently given none of such gifts and who deem
yourself unworthy and not yet advanced enough to serve Me in such
ways, to you I would say:</p>

<p>Just to the extent that you truly recognize Me within and seek in real
earnestness to serve Me, just to that extent will I use you – no
matter what your personality, no matter what its faults, tendencies
and weaknesses.</p>

<p>Yes, I will cause even you who thus seek to serve Me to do many
wondrous things towards the quickening and awakening of your brothers
to a like acknowledgment of Me. I will cause even you to influence and
affect the lives of many of those whom you contact, inspiring and
uplifting them to higher ideals, changing their way of thinking and
their attitude towards their fellows and therefore towards Me.</p>

<p>Yes, all you who seek to serve Me, no matter what your gifts, will I
make to be a vital force for good in the community, altering the mode
of life of many, inspiring and molding their ambitions and
aspirations, and altogether becoming a leavening influence in the
midst of the worldly activities in which I will place you.</p>

<p>You at the time will probably know nothing of this. You may even be
still longing to serve Me, and hungering for a more intimate
consciousness of Me, thinking you are doing nothing, are still making
many mistakes and failing to live up to your highest ideals of Me; not
realizing that this longing and hungering is the avenue through which I
pour forth My Spiritual Power, which being wholly Impersonal, is used by
you, unconscious of its being I within you using it, to bring about My
Purpose in your heart and life and in the hearts and lives of My and
Your other Selves.</p>

<p>So, as you finally grow into the realization of all this, as you
surely will, and prove it by the practical use of all you have in My
service, will I gradually give you the strength and ability to
consciously use Impersonally My Power, My Wisdom, and My Love, in the
expression of My Divine Idea, which is eternally striving to manifest
through You Its Perfection.</p>

<p>Therefore will you soon see that your human personality, with all its
faculties, powers and possessions, which are in reality Mine operating
and manifesting through you, is likewise for My use wholly, and that
true success and satisfaction can never be found except in such use.</p>

<p>For such use develops, as the planted seed develops the harvest, the
ability consciously to use all My Spiritual faculties in the final
perfect expression of My Idea, which can be expressed only through
your human personality.</p>
