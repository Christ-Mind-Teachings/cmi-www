  <p><span class="capital">N</span>ow, we begin.</p>

  <p>A little while and you shall be where I AM.<br />
It is your home,<br />
as it is the home of all who tarry still<br />
in the dance of shadows.<br />
All are coming home,<br />
for all are as we are,<br />
and this I state once again,<br />
the only Son,<br />
only begotten of the Father,<br />
begotten before all worlds,<br />
and of one substance with the Father.<br />
That alone, you are.<br />
That alone, I AM.<br />
That alone, all are.<br />
Herein is the essence of My gospel known.</p>

  <p>It is wisdom sublime,<br />
yet it is more obvious<br />
to any who would but seek it<br />
than the flow of their own breath.</p>

  <p>Never are there barriers between<br />
the forms of the Son and His Holy Father.<br />
All such barriers are but reflections<br />
of just one thought:<br />
“I am separate, I am alone.”<br />
With this is born fear,<br />
and the Son withdraws<br />
into but a point of the Light<br />
which alone he is.</p>

  <p>The belief in “other”<br />
is the insistence upon Separation.<br />
Yet this I give forth unto you:<br />
the world cannot know of this,<br />
for its thought,<br />
verily its perception,<br />
is based on Separation.<br />
Therefore,<br />
to know Me as you are<br />
requires a <strong>different</strong> knowing.<br />
My <strong>A Course in Miracles</strong> but points the way<br />
for those so deeply attached to their<br />
Judeo-Christian heritage.<br />
There are many such paths.</p>

  <p>Know this:<br />
a path home,<br />
when genuine,<br />
bids you not to believe in it,<br />
but gently nudges you beyond your delusion.<br />
The keys I have given you are found in all such paths:<br />
desire, intention, allowance, surrender.</p>

  <p>I will close this communication now,<br />
for your mind begins to ponder what is revealed.<br />
You know who you are now.<br />
You have completed the use of the first two keys.<br />
The culmination of the long, long journey which,<br />
in truth,<br />
never was,<br />
resides in the third.</p>

  <p>When this occurs,<br />
our work will begin.<br />
Blessings upon you,<br />
and all that you dream.</p>

  <p>Amen.</p>

<p class="indent">Hello, Marc.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jeshua. I love you.”</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>And I you, beloved friend.</p>

  <p>Now, we begin.</p>

  <p>Patiently do I wait for you to surrender<br />
the last thread of your resistance.<br />
Patiently, I wait.</p>

  <p>Come unto Me,<br />
and allow the world to be no more.<br />
For it has been but the faint reflection<br />
of a moment’s thought.<br />
It is not what is Real.<br />
The Kingdom resides not in a special place,<br />
nor in a special time.<br />
The Kingdom is within you.<br />
This I uttered long ago,<br />
yet still does it remain misunderstood.<br />
The Kingdom is the union of Father and Son<br />
beyond - and prior - to all shadows.<br />
It has never changed.</p>

  <p>“Within” is a metaphor, since the “you”<br />
with which you so mistakenly identify<br />
is the moment’s thought upon which the worlds<br />
of your innumerable dreams are built.</p>

  <p>The Kingdom,<br />
where you truly reside always,<br />
is within this “you”.<br />
Know this, and know this well.<br />
There is no doubt about this,<br />
for what alone is Real,<br />
is Real.<br />
What is merely shadow cast by a limited thought<br />
cannot be Real.<br />
And yet, shadows may possess a power to bind you.<br />
Know that the source of that power<br />
is your very insistence<br />
that they <strong>be</strong> real.</p>

  <p>The awakening Son is like one who seeks light,<br />
then laments the dissolution of shadows<br />
as dawn breaks gently<br />
through the night.</p>

  <p>Marc,<br />
I would ask you to consider once again<br />
the disharmony you have become sensitive to.<br />
Is it not but that final resistance<br />
upon which you so stubbornly insist?<br />
Consider this well.</p>

  <p>Let this be a sign unto you:<br />
that which flows effortlessly in your experience<br />
is, indeed, the Father’s will.<br />
That which brings fatigue,<br />
or that which brings heaviness to your countenance,<br />
is but the weight of shadows long since outgrown.<br />
I would not speak of this if it were not so.<br />
And what is your fear?<br />
Is it not also of surrendering your shadows?<br />
And is this not but the insistence<br />
upon the world’s reality?</p>

  <p>Unto you do I give this truth:<br />
The world is transformed by<br />
the renewing of your mind,<br />
for this “re-newing”<br />
is the return of the Son to His Father’s Kingdom,<br />
a perfect state of being which<br />
enlightens the world;<br />
its shadows merely disappear in a flood<br />
of brilliance which is your rightful home.<br />
Indeed,<br />
the Kingdom is already spread across the earth,<br />
but man comprehends it not.</p>

  <p>Will you not assist Me in the<br />
transforming of the world through<br />
the renewal of the Son’s mind?<br />
For this have you entered the world.<br />
For this have you suffered the world.<br />
For this have you sought Me.<br />
Let there be no mistake here:<br />
what unfolds for you in the manner of these<br />
communications is but the manifestation<br />
of your desire to share in this work.<br />
Your pain is but your refusal<br />
to accept the fulfillment of that desire.</p>

  <p>Now, we would leave you.<br />
Tarry no longer.<br />
Indeed, the time is at hand.<br />
The end of the journey is certain.<br />
Even the time has been chosen.</p>

  <p>That which I AM,<br />
is with you always,<br />
for that which I AM,<br />
you are.</p>

  <p>Amen.</p>

  <p>Now, we begin.</p>

  <p>So be it.<br />
The end is neared,<br />
the shadows pale<br />
in light incomprehensible<br />
to the mind of man.<br />
For it to be cradled in the bosom<br />
of wisdom divine,<br />
it must first be emptied<br />
of all traces of self,<br />
for “self ’ is a distortion<br />
of that which alone is Real.<br />
I AM That.</p>

  <p>Forever does not exist,<br />
for, in truth,<br />
time is not.<br />
There is but this moment<br />
and in it the arising of all worlds.<br />
Know this:<br />
that which you are<br />
resides in all times and places,<br />
yet is always beyond the shadows of illusion.</p>

  <p>The light I AM dawns<br />
in the act of recognition<br />
of what alone <strong>Is</strong>.<br />
Your only task is to allow it.</p>

  <p>The keys I have given you,<br />
and these have you used.<br />
For the Kingdom cannot be approached<br />
if there is not first desire,<br />
nor can there be movement toward it<br />
without clear and uncompromising intention.</p>

  <p>But the greatest of keys is allowance,<br />
for entry therein cannot be gained<br />
through self-effort,<br />
but through self-dissolution alone.</p>

  <p>Herein is the essence of My gospel:<br />
neither by much effort,<br />
nor yet by mere belief<br />
is the Kingdom entered,<br />
but in the end of illusion alone.<br />
Teach this.<br />
Be this.<br />
Thus does the awakened Son proclaim:<br />
“I and My Father are One.”</p>

  <p>Peace,<br />
and again I say peace,<br />
to the only begotten of the Holy Father.</p>

  <p>Amen.</p>

<p>He speaks. I write. Everything seems to disappear. Oblivious to my
physical surroundings, the dimming light of a disappearing day holds no
consequence as the pen flies along the lines of the paper. It ends. He
fades gently away, and I return to what we call reality, sitting in a
quiet apartment, hearing now the sound of a couple chatting as they walk
by on the sidewalk below my window.</p>

<p>I must turn on a light to read the words, struggling to decipher my own
hurried scribbles. I finish, and shiver involuntarily, though not
because I am cold. This is radical. It is not what I have been taught.
It is not the official dogma of my own human family. To follow where it
leads requires a boldness which I am not sure I possess (and which I’m
not sure I even want to possess). Yet there is an attraction, a feeling
deep within that wants to cry out: “Yes, yes!”</p>

<p>Plato once wrote a now famous allegory, <em>The Cave</em>. In the cave, people
lived their lives facing the walls, never turning to see what else the
cave might hold. The whole of their experience revolved around their
interaction with shadows that were always cast on the walls of the cave.
Over the course of generations, they came to believe that the shadows
comprised the whole of reality; there was no need to turn around.</p>

<p>But one day, for no apparent reason, a young boy did slightly turn his
head. At first he was disoriented and did not comprehend what he saw.
Gradually, though, it became apparent to him that the cave dwellers were
chained in such a way that all they could see were the shadows. He saw
that the cave was much more vast than he had been taught. He saw a huge
fire some distance away, being maintained by a few individuals whose
appearance was not unlike his own. With a start, he realized that the
shadows on the wall were actually being cast by the dance of the
firelight. They were not real at all!</p>

<p>He learned how to drop the chains that had unwittingly bound him, made
his way quietly past the Guardians of the Fire, and noticed a trace of
light seeping in from some point high above him. With great effort, he
climbed up to where the light was coming through and lifted himself up
out of the cave. The brilliance of the light was dazzling at first.
Everything was crystal clear! Here there were no shadows at all!</p>

<p>Then he remembered his family and friends still living in the cave,
still entranced by shadows. Climbing back inside, he returned to his
spot along the cave wall, and excitedly began to tell of his experience.
Some acted as though they could not hear him, their faces without a
trace of expression. Others turned for a moment and then looked away.
Still others warned the young boy that the light was an old myth, long
since explained away by the high priests and governors of the cave
dwellers, and that he would do well to forget it. A few, a very few,
wanted to hear more.</p>

<p>Is that what this world is? Am I, are we, living in a cave occupied with
mere shadows we cast ourselves?</p>

<p>Am I ready to give up my world? It is the only one I know, and even this
one I know not well. Or do I simply fear what lies beyond the borders -
the proscriptions of authority - of consensus “truth”?</p>

<p>Maybe it is only the feeling of intensity with which the communications
from Jeshua have been coming, or maybe it is the challenge of his
message to my own world-view built up over the past thirty-five years -
but I sense, no, struggle with, pressure within myself.</p>

<p>I confess to wishing at times that I were more naive. Less questioning.
Or maybe Kendra is right. Maybe it is, after all, a question of trust.
Lately, I sometimes find myself lost in a whirlwind of thoughts about
what is happening to me; questioning the source of this experience
called “Jeshua”, looking for some hidden, ego-based motive that <em>surely</em>
must be there, despairing at not being able to find it.</p>

<p>This is not comfortable. Sometimes I recognize the child in me wanting
to find someone to make it all go away. But after many years of
self-observation, spiritual practices, and self-improvement, I know that
I am either blessed or cursed with an orientation to life best
summarized by William James:</p>

<div class="quote">
  <p>“All around us are infinite worlds, separated from us by the flimsiest
of screens. For the most part, they remain discrete from us, but on
occasion, they may burst through to reveal themselves to us. Therefore,
we should be careful lest we close our accounts with reality too
quickly.”</p>

</div>

<p>My willingness to leave my account open has been both a boon and a bane!
But this is unlike anything I have ever encountered. My intellect does
not seem able to explain either the experience or the meaning of
Jeshua’s message. Perhaps because of that, I simply “shelve” it, as best
I can, and continue to live my life - or try to - as I am accustomed, as
I believe I ought to. Yet some part of me insists that I do whatever it
takes to understand it, to integrate it.</p>

<p>Picking up the telephone, I punch in the code that will automatically
dial Kendra’s number. Once again I have let too much time pass since
contact with this gentle soul I love so dearly. I know it is because I
want to “go lightly,” as if I could use her friendship up and there
wouldn’t be any more!</p>

<p>“Hello, Kendra?”</p>

<p>“Marc, hello! It’s funny that you called. I’ve been thinking about you a
lot lately.” She pauses for a moment, then continues. “Are you
surviving?”</p>

<p>“Always, as usual. Now, it’s okay to say ‘Didn’t I suggest this a long
time ago?’, so you might as well get it out of the way!”</p>

<p>There is a brief chuckle before she dutifully repeats the words, then
asks: “Okay, what is it that I suggested?”</p>

<p>“That I might want to schedule a session with Jeremiah to see if he can
shed some light on all this.”</p>

<p>Resting the receiver between my ear and shoulder, I grab a pencil and
notepad. “You know, I think I would be really happy at this point if
Jeremiah would tell me it’s all a projection of my subconscious,
megalomaniacal desires. Maybe I can get a prescription for hearing
voices! But give me the number, and I’ll see if I can schedule
something.”</p>

<p>Kendra reminds me that Billie Ogden, the channel for Jeremiah, is
sometimes booked far in advance.</p>

<p>“Look, let me call her now while I’m on a roll, and I’ll call you right
back.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes, I am back on the phone with Kendra. “Guess what. She
just had a cancellation, and I can see her tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Kendra, of course, cannot let this chance go by. “So that means I’ll see
you tomorrow night, right?”</p>

<p>I smile, knowing that now I really have no choice but to go through with
it. “Tomorrow night it is. Thanks for the number. Bye.”</p>

<p>After exchanging pleasantries with Billie, we ready the tape recorder
and settle down on the sofa. Doing my best to relax, I patiently wait
for the change to occur, for Billie to leave and Jeremiah to appear.
Whatever this phenomena is, I am always fascinated by the noticeable
physical changes that occur: Billie’s face subtly changes shape, her
body begins to appear larger somehow.</p>

<p>Finally, her head raises, and a voice very different from Billie’s, with
a far different style of language, begins to speak. “Dear heart, you
have questions to ask?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I reply. “Well, actually, I had thought of preparing a list of
them, but decided to just trust the flow of our session.”</p>

<p>There is a faint smile. “Is wisdom there, dear heart.”</p>

<p>“One of the problems I have is that, while I am learning to listen to my
heart, following it seems to be another thing.”</p>

<p>“Is because you get tangled up with the intellect. That which causes
pain, dear heart, is the confusion between the intellect and the heart.
At this time, what we say to you is that the best way to come from your
heart is to have only the willingness to let go of what you know. To let
go of the training you have had. The source of all life, you see, is
what you can call God, or Love, the Oneness of all things. Dear heart,
until you let go of who you think you are, you cannot receive wisdom
from the Universe.”</p>

<p>Shifting my position so I can look directly at Jeremiah, I ask: “Can you
shed any light on my experience with Jesus, if I had any at all?”
Wanting to know if I might receive information similar to that received
by Kendra so many months ago, I have deliberately not mentioned Kendra,
nor Jeshua.</p>

<p>There is a very long pause, and Jeremiah’s reply abruptly stops me: “Is
not so much that you are having an experience with Jeshua, but that you
<em>are</em>. That is <em>your</em> lifetime.”</p>

<p>Jeremiah used the name “Jeshua,” but I know I had avoided doing that!
There is no way for Billie to have known about him!</p>

<p>I stumble over my own words: “That, uh, that is, uh, my lifetime? Could
you, uh, would you, uh, clarify that, please?”</p>

<p>“First, we will explain to you, so that there will be a better
understanding for you, of what you call ‘lifetimes.’ Is not so much,
dear heart, that you have many, many lifetimes, one here, one there,
then another, in what you call time. You do not have what is called
‘past’ lifetimes. We talk about past lifetimes because it is that which
the human mind understands but, in truth, it is not so. You only have
lifetimes you are living <em>now</em>.”</p>

<p>I feel myself leaning closer, hanging on every word.</p>

<p>“You see, dear heart, you are like a book, and there are many pages in
the book, and the pages are all transparent. Therefore, when you look at
the book, you see the whole. But if you take just one page out, you see
only that page. The further away you get from the book, the less of it
you can see, so you call it ‘past lives.’ But indeed, it is not. It is
still your lifetime. You are in many places at one time, living many
lives, now. You are the being you ask of.”</p>

<p>I am stunned. “I, uh, I <em>am</em> this being I call ‘Jeshua’?”</p>

<p>“Is so. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Uh, yeah.” Right. I may understand the words I have just heard, but
their meaning - well, that is another matter. Something tells me the
Pope would not agree with this at all.</p>

<p>“Jeremiah, we grow up here in a culture with, well, with a rather
different view of Jesus. And now you are saying that I <em>am</em> that life?”</p>

<p>“Is so.”</p>

<p>“So, would you say that, as lately, Jeshua is communicating with me more
and more clearly, that I, uh, I am…”</p>

<p>Jeremiah finishes the sentence for me: “It is that you are willing to
look at the pages that you are.”</p>

<p>I am reduced to silence as my mind tries to absorb what I am hearing,
seeing the inevitable conclusions as pictures stealing briefly across an
invisible screen, conclusions which turn the world upside down and
inside out. This is radical, in the most fundamental sense of the word.</p>

<p>“Dear heart, is all right.” Jeremiah’s voice is softer now, soothing
ruffled nerves, seeing my plight even though the physical eyes are
closed. “Is that you have what is called ‘judgment’ going on. Is that
you have created a mindset that says you are only this being called
‘Marc.’ Therefore, because this is all that you think you are, it does
not have the value of this being you call ‘Jeshua’.</p>

<p>“It is the pattern we see in the framework of thy being, that you hold
the idea that all are the only begotten sons of God, yet still you
insist that Jeshua is the real begotten Son of God. Therefore you cannot
see the equality. But, dear heart, there is only equality, because there
is only one Mind. Until it is that you are ready to look at thy brother
as thy self for, indeed, it is that you lead the lifetime of every
being…”</p>

<p>Now, it is my turn to interrupt. “I…I live the life of <em>every</em> being?”</p>

<p>“Is so. Every lifetime ever lived is but one lifetime. There is no
separation. It is to know, dear heart, that you are the holy, begotten
Son of God, the <em>only</em> begotten Son of God. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>I sit very still, staring at nothing at all. I do not know how much time
goes by, sitting there staring out into space. What would an onlooker
see? A man and a woman, sitting on a sofa, silently. Not lost in the
panacea called television, nor listening to music, apparently not
interacting at all. Just two bodies, sitting on the sofa.</p>

<p>But inwardly nothing is still. Energies are pulsating through every cell
of my body. Images race through my mind; flashes of brilliant, colored
lights seem to fly by as though I were traveling at incredible speeds.</p>

<p>Finally I am able to speak, and as I do so, there is a return of more
familiar surroundings, though I still do not move, nor do I even turn my
head to look at Jeremiah. Somewhere inside me there is a knowing that we
could carry on this conversation without being in the same room, or even
on the same planet.</p>

<p>“So, the Son is doing all this? All of us, then, are the murderer, the
rapist, the king, the poet?”</p>

<p>Jeremiah is smiling now, and speaks easily, confidently, as a teacher
who is sure that his student is, at least, beginning to comprehend.
“When one comes to the <em>full</em> awareness of that who he is, then <em>all</em> will
move closer to that Oneness. The greatest gift you can offer to the
world is to come into your own full awareness of who you <em>are</em>. When you
love all that you are, you will have given to mankind that love, that
acceptance, for to awaken to who you are, you will recognize that you
<em>are</em> all things.”</p>

<p>Not skipping a beat, Jeremiah continues: “It is that you have these tiny
borders, these little rules, that say what life is. And because what you
receive does not fit within these rules, it is very difficult to deal
with. It does not fit in the box. You must push out the borders of your
mind. This is why we tell you to <em>allow</em>. Allow it to be, even if it does
not fit into your current perceptions. This will push out the borders of
your mind.”</p>

<p>Slowly nodding my head, I reach over and turn off the tape machine,
silently saying “Thank you” to Jeremiah, then rest back on the sofa,
waiting for Jeremiah to leave and Billie to return.</p>

<p>Billie offers me refreshments. “Often, people don’t seem ready to leave
just yet. At first I was uncomfortable with it, because I didn’t know if
I should say or do anything. So I just got used to hanging out with
them.”</p>

<p>“Do you have any idea what goes on in these sessions?” I ask.</p>

<p>“No. But it was harder to come back this time. I think Jeremiah’s energy
was pretty strong.” She doesn’t seem much interested in this line of
questioning, so I let it drop.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll skip the tea, and head out.”</p>

<p>At the door, I pause and turn back to her. “Saying ‘thank you’ doesn’t
seem like quite enough, but I’m glad you let this happen.”</p>

<p>Billie smiles broadly. “Oh, I guess I learned it’s okay. I mean, it
seems to help a lot of people, and that is all I need to know about it.”</p>

<p>I nod my head, turn, and walk down the hallway to the elevator. Driving
first toward, then through Seattle, the traffic is hardly noticed. The
hour-and-a-half drive south to Kendra’s is over in what seems like an
instant.</p>

<p>“Come in! How did it go? Do you have the tape?” Kendra is obviously
excited, as well as curious.</p>

<p>‘Without saying anything, I give her a big, long hug, then hand her the
tape and sit down on the floor. I watch her cross the room, where she
opens the door of a beautiful, handcarved antique cupboard that serves
as her stereo cabinet. She slips the tape in, then sits down on the
floor beside me.</p>

<p>As we listen, I can see that Kendra is quite involved, listening
intently to every word. As the tape reaches the part about Jeshua, I can
feel my heart beating faster, waiting for her reaction:</p>

<div class="quote">
“It is not so much that you have an experience *with* Jeshua, but that you
*are*. That is *your* lifetime.”

</div>

<p>Kendra turns her head toward me, eyes showing surprise, asking for an
explanation.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t mean what you think. Well, not exactly.”</p>

<p>Finally, the tape is finished. After awhile, Kendra speaks softly.
“Well, there isn’t much that can be said to <em>that</em>.” She starts chuckling.</p>

<p>“So what is so funny?”</p>

<p>She looks at me askance. “I don’t know. Nothing, I guess. Maybe I’m
chuckling because I don’t know what to say!”</p>

<p>I sense an opportunity for a good jab here about her, of all people,
being speechless, but I let it pass. “Do you remember the part about
allowing?” I ask.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replies. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Jeshua has been talking about that with me. He said that the stage of
my own process of awakening could be called the stage of ‘allowing.’
Rather an odd coincidence, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Smiling, eyes sparkling now, Kendra replies, without pausing to give it
a thought. “‘Coincidence’ is a word for connections we do not
understand, or don’t want to understand.” She turns to look at me, then
continues. “And you know it, too!”</p>

<p>I smile back at her. “Yeah. Hey, maybe all these apparently nonphysical
beings are collaborating. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“I think,” she pauses and takes a deep breath, “I think that if you
listen at all to them, it is a lot more than collaboration.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I ask the question, but already know her answer.</p>

<p>“There is only one Mind.”</p>

<p>For the longest time we look at each other, or at ourselves. Or the one
Mind, the one Son, looks at itself.</p>

<p>Whatever the words used to describe the experience, there is a feeling,
a momentary knowledge beyond any doubt that for both of us - melts all
boundaries, all divisions, all doubts.</p>

<p>“Well,” I finally speak, almost at a whisper, “I should probably be
going.”</p>

<p>I could swear that the sparkle in her eyes fades a bit, and I sense that
the spell has been broken. Or is it, perhaps, that we are choosing to
<em>return</em> to it?</p>

<p>On the way home, I feel as though I am six feet off the ground. The
Tacoma city skyline is alive with vibrant energy. Yet even in this
moment, after all this time with Jeshua, and the impact of the session
with Jeremiah, I can already recognize a now familiar energy almost
imperceptibly rising within me. Have you ever experienced knowing
something beyond doubt, and also knowing just as clearly that you are
refusing to accept it no matter how obvious it is? Perhaps it seems
simpler that way.</p>
