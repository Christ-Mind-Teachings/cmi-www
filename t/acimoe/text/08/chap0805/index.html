    <p><sup>25</sup> If Godâ€™s Will for you is complete peace and joy, unless you
experience <em>only</em> this you must be refusing to <em>acknowledge</em> His Will.
His Will does not vacillate, being changeless forever. When you are not
at peace, it can only be because you do not believe you <em>are</em> in Him.
Yet He is all in all. His peace is complete, and you <em>must</em> be included
in it. His laws govern you, because they govern <em>everything</em>. You cannot
exempt yourself from His laws, although you can disobey them. Yet if you
do, and <em>only</em> if you do, you <em>will</em> feel lonely and helpless, because
you are denying yourself everything.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup> I am come as a light into a world that <em>does</em> deny itself everything.
It does this simply by dissociating itself <em>from</em> everything. It is
therefore an illusion of isolation, maintained by fear of the same
loneliness which <em>is</em> its illusion. I have told you that I am with you
always, even to the end of the world. That is <em>why</em> I am the light of
the world. If I am with you in the loneliness of the world, <em>the
loneliness is gone.</em> You <em>cannot</em> maintain the illusion of loneliness if
you are <em>not</em> alone. My purpose, then, <em>is</em> to overcome the world. I do
not attack it, but my light must dispel it because of what it <em>is</em>.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup> Light does not attack darkness, but it <em>does</em> shine it away. If my
light goes with you everywhere, <em>you</em> shine it away <em>with</em> me. The light
becomes <em>ours</em>, and you cannot abide in darkness any more than darkness
can abide wherever you go. The remembrance of me <em>is</em> the remembrance of
yourself and of Him Who sent me to you. You were in darkness until Godâ€™s
Will was done completely by <em>any</em> part of the Sonship. When this was
done, it was perfectly accomplished by <em>all</em>. How else could it <em>be</em>
perfectly accomplished? My mission was simply to unite the will of the
Sonship with the Will of the Father by being aware of the Fatherâ€™s Will
myself. This is the awareness I came to give <em>you</em>, and your problem in
accepting it <em>is</em> the problem of this world. Dispelling it is salvation,
and in this sense I <em>am</em> the salvation of the world.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup> The world must despise and reject me, because the world <em>is</em> the
belief that love is impossible. <em>Your</em> reactions to me are the reactions
of the world to God. If you will accept the fact that I am with you, you
are <em>denying</em> the world and <em>accepting</em> God. My will is His, and <em>your</em>
will to hear me is the decision to hear His Voice and abide in His Will.
As God sent me to you, so will I send you to others, and I will go to
them <em>with</em> you so we can teach them [union and peace].</p>

<p><sup>29</sup> Do you not think the world <em>needs</em> peace as much as you do? Do you
not want to <em>give</em> it to the world as much as you want to <em>receive</em> it?
For unless you do, you will <em>not</em> receive it. If you will to have it of
me, you <em>must</em> give it. Rehabilitation does not come from anyone else.
You can have guidance from without, but you must <em>accept</em> it from
within. The guidance must [become] what <em>you</em> want, or it will be
meaningless to you. That is why rehabilitation is a collaborative
venture.</p>

<p><sup>30</sup> I can tell you what to do, but this will not help you unless you
collaborate by believing that I <em>know</em> what to do. Only then will your
mind choose to follow me. Without <em>your</em> will, you cannot <em>be</em>
rehabilitated. <em>Motivation</em> to be healed is the crucial factor in
rehabilitation. Without this you are deciding <em>against</em> healing, and
your veto of my will for you <em>makes healing impossible</em>. If healing <em>is</em>
our joint will, unless our wills <em>are</em> joined you <em>cannot</em> be healed.
This is obvious when you consider what healing is <em>for</em>. Healing is the
way in which the separation is overcome. Separation is overcome by
<em>union</em>. It cannot be overcome by separating.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup> The <em>will</em> to unite must be unequivocal, or the will <em>itself</em> is
divided or not whole. Your will is the means by which you determine your
own condition, because will is the <em>mechanism</em> of decision. It is the
power by which you separate or join and experience pain or joy
accordingly. My will cannot <em>overcome</em> yours, because yours is as
powerful as mine. If it were not so, the Sons of God would be unequal.
All things are possible through our <em>joint</em> will, but my will alone
cannot help you. Your will is as free as mine, and God Himself would not
go against it. <em>I</em> cannot will what God does <em>not</em> will. I can offer you
my will to make <em>yours</em> invincible by this sharing, but I cannot
<em>oppose</em> yours without competing with it and thereby violating Godâ€™s
Will for you.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup> Nothing God created can oppose your will, as nothing God created can
oppose His. God <em>gave</em> your will its power, which I can only acknowledge
in honor of <em>His</em>. If you want to be like me, I will help you, knowing
that we <em>are</em> alike. If you want to be different, I will wait until you
change your mind. I can <em>teach</em> you, but only you can choose to <em>listen</em>
to my teaching. How else can it be, if Godâ€™s Kingdom <em>is</em> freedom?
Freedom cannot be learned by tyranny of any kind, and the perfect
equality of <em>all</em> Godâ€™s Sons cannot be recognized through the dominion
of one will over another. Godâ€™s Sons are equal in will, all being the
Will of their Father. This is the <em>only</em> lesson I came to teach, knowing
that it is true.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup> When your will is <em>not</em> mine, it is not our Fatherâ€™s. This means that
you have imprisoned <em>yours</em> and have not <em>let</em> it be free. Of yourselves
you can do nothing, because of yourselves you <em>are</em> nothing. I am
nothing without the Father, and <em>you</em> are nothing without <em>me</em>, because
by denying the Father you deny <em>yourself</em>. I will <em>always</em> remember you,
and in <em>my</em> remembrance of you lies your remembrance of <em>yourself.</em> In
our remembrance of <em>each other</em> lies our remembrance of God, and in this
remembrance lies your freedom, because your freedom <em>is</em> in Him. Join
then with me in praise of Him <em>and</em> you whom He created. This is our
gift of gratitude to Him, which He will share with <em>all</em> His creations,
to whom He gives equally whatever is acceptable to Him. <em>Because</em> it is
acceptable to Him, it is the gift of freedom, which <em>is</em> His Will for
all His Sons. By <em>offering</em> freedom, <em>you</em> will be free.</p>

<p><sup>34</sup> Freedom is the only gift you can offer to Godâ€™s Sons, being an
acknowledgment of what <em>they</em> are and what <em>He</em> is. Freedom is creation,
because it is love. What you seek to imprison you do <em>not</em> love.
Therefore, when you seek to imprison anyone, including <em>yourself</em>, you
do not love him, and you cannot identify <em>with</em> him. When you imprison
yourself, you are losing sight of your true identification with me and
with the Father. Your identification <em>is</em> with the Father and with the
Son. It <em>cannot</em> be with one and not the other. If you are part of one,
you must be part of the other, because they <em>are</em> one.</p>

<p><sup>35</sup> The Holy Trinity is holy, <em>because</em> it is one. If you exclude
<em>yourself</em> from this union, you are perceiving the Holy Trinity as
separated. You must be included <em>in</em> It, because It <em>is</em> everything.
Unless you take your place in It and fulfill your function as <em>part</em> of
It, It is as bereft as <em>you</em> are. No part of It can be imprisoned if Its
truth is to be known. Can you be separated from your identification and
be at peace? Dissociation is not a solution; it is a <em>delusion</em>. The
delusional believe that truth will assail them, and so they do not <em>see</em>
it, because they <em>prefer</em> the delusion. Judging truth as something they
do <em>not</em> want, they perceive deception and block knowledge.</p>

<p><sup>36</sup> Help them by offering them <em>your</em> unified will on their behalf, as I
am offering you mine on <em>yours</em>. Alone we can do nothing, but <em>together</em>
our wills fuse into something whose power is far beyond the power of its
separate parts. By <em>not being separate</em>, the Will of God is established
<em>in</em> ours and <em>as</em> ours. This will is invincible, <em>because</em> it is
undivided. The undivided will of the Sonship is the perfect creator,
being wholly in the likeness of God, Whose Will it <em>is.</em> <em>You</em> cannot be
exempt from it if you are to understand what <em>it</em> is and what <em>you</em> are.
By separating your will <em>from</em> mine, you are exempting yourself from the
Will of God, which <em>is</em> yourself.</p>

<p><sup>37</sup> Yet to heal is still to make whole. Therefore, to heal is to <em>unite</em>
with those who are like you, because perceiving this likeness <em>is</em> to
recognize the Father. If <em>your</em> perfection is in Him and <em>only</em> in Him,
how can you <em>know</em> it without recognizing Him? The recognition of God
<em>is</em> the recognition of yourself. There <em>is</em> no separation of God and
His creation. You will learn this as you learn that there is no
separation of <em>your</em> will and <em>mine</em>. Let the love of God shine upon you
by your acceptance of me. <em>My</em> reality is yours <em>and</em> His. By joining
your will with mine, you are signifying your awareness that the Will of
God is one.</p>

<p><sup>38</sup> Godâ€™s Oneness and ours are not separate, because His Oneness
<em>encompasses</em> ours. To join with me is to restore His power to you,
<em>because</em> we are sharing it. I offer you only the <em>recognition</em> of His
power in you, but in that lies <em>all</em> truth. As <em>we</em> unite, we unite with
Him. Glory be to the union of God and His holy Sons! All glory lies in
them <em>because</em> they are united. The miracles we do bear witness to the
Will of the Father for His Son and to our joy in uniting <em>with</em> His Will
for us.</p>

<p><sup>39</sup> When you unite with me, you are uniting <em>without</em> the ego, because I
have renounced the ego in myself and therefore <em>cannot</em> unite with
yours. <em>Our</em> union is therefore the way to renounce the ego in
<em>yourself.</em> The truth in both of us is <em>beyond</em> the ego. By willing
that, you <em>have</em> gone beyond it toward truth. Our success in
transcending the ego is guaranteed by God, and I can share [my perfect
confidence in His promise, because I know He gave me] this confidence
for both of us and <em>all</em> of us. I bring Godâ€™s peace back to all His
Children, because I received it of Him for us all. Nothing can prevail
against our united wills, because nothing can prevail against Godâ€™s.
Would you know the Will of God for <em>you</em>? Ask it of me who knows it
<em>for</em> you, and you will find it. I will deny you nothing, as God denies
<em>me</em> nothing.</p>

<p><sup>40</sup> Ours is simply the journey back to God, Who is our home. Whenever
fear intrudes anywhere along the road to peace, it is <em>always</em> because
the ego has attempted to join the journey with us <em>and</em> <em>cannot do so</em>.
Sensing defeat and angered by it, the ego regards itself as rejected and
becomes retaliative. You are invulnerable to its retaliation, <em>because I
am with you</em>. On this journey, you have chosen me as your companion
<em>instead</em> of the ego. Do not try to hold on to both, or you will try to
go in different directions and will lose the way.</p>

<p><sup>41</sup> The egoâ€™s way is not mine, but it is also <em>not yours</em>. The Holy
Spirit has <em>one</em> direction for <em>all</em> minds, and the one He taught me is
<em>yours</em>. Let us not lose sight of His direction through illusions, for
only illusions of another direction can obscure the one for which Godâ€™s
Voice speaks in all of us. Never accord the ego the power to interfere
with the journey because it <em>has</em> none, [and] the journey is the way
to what is true. Leave <em>all</em> deception behind and reach beyond all
attempts of the ego to hold you back. I go before you, because I <em>am</em>
beyond the ego. Reach therefore for my hand, because you <em>want</em> to
transcend the ego. My will will <em>never</em> be wanting, and if you <em>want</em> to
share it you <em>will</em>. I give it willingly and gladly, because I need you
as much as you need me.</p>
