    <p>Now we begin.</p>

<p>Indeed greetings unto you, beloved and holy children of Light divine,
indeed offspring of the One Who has been called God. And if you are that
offspring, indeed you are created in your Father’s image and in you
remains the power to heal every false perception, to leave the world of
split-mindedness behind you, and to indeed perceive the real world and
to abide within it. And what can that real world be if not the extension
of love that need not be sent through a filter of fear. For, indeed, it
is that filter that keeps the mind split and the heart at least
partially yet concealed. And when you choose wholly to remember the
Truth of your being, then you hold the power and the freedom to give all
things over to the Holy Spirit. You can throw open the shutters of the
heart and even of the cells of the body and ask—and know you will
receive—that every last trace of shadow shall be released from you.</p>

<p>For those of you that believe that healing can come only to the mind, is
it not wise to ask where the mind is? And as I have sought to teach
you—the body arises <em>within</em> the mind, not the other way around. And,
therefore, what you see as these lumps of flesh express quite
exquisitely the patterns of belief that you have held in the mind. For
the body can only serve the thoughts you choose to hold, and it will do
so to perfection.</p>

<p>Therefore, if there has been a thought or a belief grounded in the
misperception that you are separate from God, and therefore in the soil
of fear you have perceived an inequality between yourself and your
brother and believe that you live in a fearful world, understand well
that that creates reaction in the very cells of the body; and the cells
themselves become like holding tanks and you hold on quite deeply and
quite strongly to ancient wounds and ancient hurts.</p>

<p>And though you hold the thought in the mind,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am the arisen Christ,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>until you are truly willing to throw open the shutters of even the cells
of the body and to let all of those little dark shadows fly away, you
are still holding on to one small dark belief, choosing to claim it as
your own, and you have not released all things to the Holy Spirit for
healing.</p>

<p>You cannot know what will transpire when truly you release the hold on
that last little corner of your mind that you would hold on to and claim
to be your own. But you can, with great faith, trust the process that
the Holy Spirit would use to release every shadow—so that even the body
becomes capable of radiance.</p>

<p>What is radiance? It is only the Light you are without anything creating
an obstacle to its expression. Therefore, precious friends, fear not the
release of the chronic hold you have had even within the cells of the
body. For the body is only an extension of your thought.</p>

<p>If you are loved wholly and in your Father’s eyes you have never sinned,
what then is there to fear? To fear healing? To fear release? Indeed, to
fear tears? Tears and laughter are your grandest of healers and your
greatest of teachers. And I confess they are far greater than I, for all
I can do is come and talk to you. I can come and bring my countenance
upon you, and I can stand by your side as your friend and your
brother—and I certainly don’t mean just momentarily as I borrow the mind
and body of my beloved brother here—but whenever you turn to me, I can
be with you; for indeed I am with you always.</p>

<p>But what your laughter and tears can bring to you cannot be measured.
Therefore, fear them not and judge them not. Do not create an
inequality, saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, I much prefer laughter over tears.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have made the choice to choose healing, then embrace your tears
as much as your laughter, and give thanks when they arise. Throw open
the shutters of the body and let the tears create shaking in the body.
It cannot destroy you because you are not the body. You are that which
utilizes it as a vehicle of communication. And when you therefore hold
on in the palm of your hand to that shadow, it creates constriction in
the body out of fear, and you are choosing to limit what this beautiful
vehicle can do. And it will do precisely what you command it to do.</p>

<p>There is no one here who could not walk on water. There is no one here
who could not extend healing through the body. And what prevents it?
That small little corner that you have been holding on to for an awfully
long time.</p>

<p>The message that I would bring you in this hour is this: fear not
healing. Yes, it feels like change, and thank God for that. Because if
there has been depression, there have been old wounds from which you
have been acting out and acting out and acting out, as it is called in
your language. Is it not time to release it? If you would indeed be the
arisen Christ, then truly have the courage to throw open the cells of
the body.</p>

<p>Now, how to you do that? You don’t. But abiding in faith and asking the
Holy Spirit for the help you need, indeed helpers will come because they
have been assigned to you. And it will not be by accident that certain
ones will come into your life; and in Truth if you are desirous of
healing, be vigilant to see who it is that comes into your life. And
understand that they are sent to you because you have asked of the one
Teacher, Whose guidance never errs, for healing and for completion.</p>

<p>Healing, then, can often feel like death because, of course, it is. It
is the death of a false illusion that you have held and clung to in
error. And if you would be the servant of your Father—and I say this not
in a serious vein but in a very light vein, because to be a servant of
the Father is to be one who expresses love and joy and laughter and play
and certainty and strength and humility and compassion and patience and
vision— and if indeed you would be the servant of your Father, let that
death occur down to the tips of your toes. You will not taste death, but
an illusion will dissolve away.</p>

<p>Many of you are yet hoping, fervently hoping, that you can achieve
awakening by holding the thought in the mind,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am the arisen Christ.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a great place—and the only place—to start. You cannot approach
healing as long as you hold the attitude that you are separate from God,
because you will create a veil of fear and you will go through process
after process after process, but you will never get to the nub of
it—because you don’t want to.</p>

<p>Therefore, when you understand in the mind, in the heart, the Truth of
who you are, that becomes the very foundation and the strength and the
faith to allow the Holy Spirit to completely remake even the cells of
the body. Notice that I said the cells of “the” body, not the cells of
“your” body, because the arisen Christ knows he is not the body and does
not possess it, that he does not begin where the body starts and he will
not end when the body is returned to this Earth. He knows that the body
is given of the Holy Mother for nothing save the extension of the
unconditional Love of God.</p>

<p>And from that foundation you will find your strength to allow the
complete and radical transformation of every aspect of your being: it is
called the personality, which is just a mask made up of fear that can be
translated into a vehicle of communication; the emotional body, which is
the core where you have held all of those ancient wounds; and even the
cells of the body. Therefore, your Kingdom shall be made new again.</p>

<p>Precious friends, fear not the complete healing of every trace of
illusion that you have harbored within your being. And if it feels like
death, then embrace it. It is the only death that truly counts, you see.</p>

<p>What, then, prolongs the process of healing? <em>Resistance</em> to it, born
out of the chronic holding on to nothing more than illusions. And when
that illusion has truly been laid down, the body will arise, the
emotions will arise, the mind, the personality will arise—but will be
made new. The dreamer will have been laid to rest and the arisen Christ
will finally live through you.</p>

<p>And I ask you to join with me in the willingness to allow that healing
to occur: to embrace your laughter and to embrace your tears and to
embrace every opportunity to let go of the shadows that bind you.</p>

<p><em>How, then, can you ask the Holy Spirit to heal you if there are dark
comers which you have refused to look at, or how can you hand to the
Holy Spirit what you have not yet embraced?</em></p>

<p>Illusions remain powerful when you refuse to acknowledge them. And many
yet hold the fear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What will happen if I truly look my illusions squarely in the eye and
acknowledge that, by God, they have been controlling me? Will they be
the demons that master me?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Herein lies the purpose of faith:</em> to know that you are the arisen
Christ, that you abide in perfect union with God in the real world, and
that you are given and sent to translate this unreal world of illusions
and insanity into the real world; and you do it by acknowledging that
yes, you have been living there all along and it is time to heal it.</p>

<p>Healing really does not take effort. It takes allowing. Allowing,
allowing, allowing, every day and with every breath. So that your
illusion—this <em>unreal</em> world—becomes translated and becomes the perfect
reflection of the <em>real</em> world. And it can be painless when your
perception changes, that healing is not frightful, that it is okay to
cry in front of a friend. It is okay to pick up the phone and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Lordy, do I need you tonight.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s okay to say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>There is something going on that I don’t understand, but I am not
going to constrict. I am going to throw the body open. And if I
convulse and if I vomit and if I cry and if I scream, who cares? It’s
just the release of old shadows that have no place in the body and the
mind and the emotions of the only begotten child of God.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is well and good to recite certain words,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am the arisen Christ. I live in joy and I live in Light.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if you have not looked to be sure that you have embraced every
shadow, it remains in the realm of a thought and it has not yet
manifested as your living reality.</p>

<p>That is why so many become frustrated. They do all the metaphysical
games. They even come and listen to me and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Jeshua said I am the arisen Christ. Therefore, ah, I can avoid the
process of healing.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are the arisen Christ—and I assure you that you are—<em>you will
want to embrace the</em> <em>very process of insuring that no trace of illusion
remains within you.</em> You will not deceive yourself. You will not lie to
yourself. And when those shadows are made present to your consciousness,
you will give thanks to the Holy Spirit and to the brothers and sisters
that have thrown them into your face, because they are messengers of
God. They are saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Here, look at this, so that you can embrace it and release it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fear not shadows, because you are made of Light, a Light so powerful
that it can dissolve shadows in the instant you truly choose to embrace
them and acknowledge them. That is how powerful each of you truly is.
And the day comes when you no longer need helpers to dissolve those
shadows, because with their help you have learned it’s safe to embrace
them, that they hold no power of mastery over you.</p>

<p>The only reason there are such things as healers or teachers or masters
is because yet within the drama you believe you need them; and not
understanding the strength within you, you need to reach out for the
strength of another. By all means do so. One who is truly awakening to
the Christ within them recognizes how worthy they are of the help of the
universe.</p>

<p>And yet, how many times—and be honest—how many times have each of you
felt that you are not really worthy of seeking and reaching out for
help?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I better just stuff this. After all, I don’t want to bother anybody
today.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone know that energy?</p>

<p>God has created you as a Thought of perfect Love in form. And when you
choose to manifest that reality, do you think He sits by idly and goes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, I don’t know if you are really worthy of what I can bring to
you.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is just the opposite. You are the one to whom the universe is given.
You—you—are the beloved of God.</p>

<p>Therefore, when you know you need help, reach out for it. To do so is an
act of power. It says that you understand your worth and you will do
anything to let Christ be born in you.</p>

<p>The time comes quickly upon this Earth when you are going to need to
have made sure that you’ve healed every wound and every false
perception. And the wounds can only be healed to the degree that you are
willing to open up and allow that healing. Not to use the power of the
mind to deceive yourself, but to understand the Truth of the long
journey you’ve been making, because it’s been very complex. You are
never going to really be able to look back and pinpoint the moments when
a certain perception started. It’s not really necessary, but you will at
times be able to access certain memories that exhibit the power of that
false perception. And as those moments are healed, you have healed all
of them.</p>

<p>And isn’t that a lucky thing? It would be a rather long journey if you
had to heal every moment in which you let a false perception lead you
astray. But in each of those moments, they are really all the same. So
to heal one is to heal them all. And whether healing comes because one
taps into a past life, or healing comes because they have realized that
yesterday they exhibited something that was not loving and they bring
the Light of the Spirit to it because they have embraced it, the healing
is the same, and they have healed the whole of their past. It is not
necessary to hold the belief in reincarnation and it is not necessary to
go forth a thousand lifetimes backward to find what needs to be healed.
Because if it needs to be healed, it is with you right where you are.</p>

<p>Learn to look upon all of your thoughts and all of your actions and all
of your dreams and all of your perceptions and ask of yourself,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Is this truly the will of God? Or is there a trace of fear in it? Is
there a trace of limitation? Is this something that I’ve seen cropping
up over and over again?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it crops up over and over, you know it is in need of healing.</p>

<p>Healing has been grossly misunderstood. It’s really not the fixing of
anything, because to do that assumes that it is already real and that
there is someone who can fix it. <em>Healing is the mastery of allowing</em>.
Healing is the mastery of allowing: to allow all things, so that they
can be embraced and loved and thereby transcended. Never use the mind to
minimize your behavior, your thoughts. Never use the mind to do that,
because to do that you will only ensure that you will repeat that
perception, that behavior, ad nauseam.</p>

<p>You are worthy of the depth of your healing. You are worthy of seeing
that in Truth the journey has already been completed, and your Father is
just waiting for you to truly throw open the shutters and allow the
fullness of the power of Christ to be lived through you. And that is
fearful to the small little shadow you have been clinging to.</p>

<p>You have heard it said in your world that many fear failure. The fear of
failure ensures it. But a far greater fear is the fear of success. And
in this term, in the use of this term, I am not talking about success in
worldly terms. I am talking about the success of living as Christ,
wholly, without obstacle or block. It is that fear that leads you to
hold on to the small, powerless, weak and insane shadow that you have
believed yourself to be since before time began. <em>It takes courage to
release that. It takes courage to ask for help. It</em> <em>takes courage to
die.</em></p>

<p>The whole purpose of the crucifixion is not that it saved anybody from
their sins. It never did that. The purpose of the crucifixion was to
demonstrate where you will continue to be throughout all of eternity
until you are willing to truly let that small little shadow die and to
claim your power, not just as a thought or a belief—although that’s
where it starts—but to allow that power to transform the emotions and
every cell of the body. Then, indeed, the resurrection has been
realized.</p>

<p>And if I can raise the body and ascend unto my Father, so can you. I am
not saying that you have to be able to be nailed to a cross so that the
body dies and then resurrected in three days and ascend before your
disciples. Of course not. I am saying that that was a demonstration of
what has to happen to your perceptions of yourself, which is that which
makes up the ego.</p>

<p>A true healer knows that they heal nothing. A true healer knows that
they fix nothing. The truest among them simply makes themself available
and learns to speak a language that the one who perceives themselves as
sick or diseased can understand. And they will abide with them and they
will speak that language and they will use their modalities that they
have learned, but all the while they know Who It is that will effect the
healing. It actually comes from the communication of that soul or that
person with the Holy Spirit in whatever form they choose to think of it.
And an agreement is made that healing will come because that soul has
finally chosen to allow it. And often all they need is the safety of
being with a healer.</p>

<p>The greatest of healers are those that have understood that they have
needed to allow correction to come to their own mind and their own
emotions and their own bodies. And, indeed, <em>the greatest of healers
never cease in that process.</em> That is what keeps them in the line of
power, if you want to call it that, so that the Holy Spirit can work
through them.</p>

<p>A true healer is one who has, in a sense, made a grand sacrifice of
their life. They no longer are anxious to get to the end of healing but
they enact the act of healing daily, throwing themselves open always so
that they remain in communication with those that come to them, and
never forget what it means to be <em>in</em> the process of healing.</p>

<p>Now that is very paradoxical, and I hope you will take some time to
contemplate it. Because in the act of, in a sense, donning the cloak of
one who is constantly working on their healing, they are actually
liberated. And out of their liberation they take on the form of one
involved in healing, so that they can be with their brothers and sisters
and be an effective channel of healing. Does that make sense? It is very
important. Very important. If ever you come across a healer that says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I have already got it all licked; now let me fix you,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>please turn around and leave, because that is an unhealed healer.</p>

<p>There are many of you in this room who are making shifts in
consciousness, and your compassion has opened. Your understanding that
there is nothing outside of you has begun to open, and you have thus
begun to see that your brother and sister is not outside of you and
<em>cannot</em> be outside of you. And out of your compassion, you want to help
them heal. You will be effective to the degree that you allow, in every
day, healing to come to you; and to never shut your heart to that
process. And if it means that you think you may cry tears in every day
of your life for the next two hundred and forty-seven years, you will
gladly do it—because that keeps you in that line of power so that the
Holy Spirit can work through your humble heart, and extend the healing
to the one who has asked for it but needs you as an intermediary because
their strength is not yet certain enough to come to the throne of God
directly.</p>

<p>And the greatest of days will come when all of the healers that
understand what it means to truly be healers are out of work. And then
they, too, will rejoice because their work will have been finished.</p>

<p>Please do not fear healing. But I have come to speak about that specific
subject tonight because there are some among you who are creating a
dichotomy within yourself. You are actually widening the split while
holding on to the illusion, created with the power of the mind, that you
have already gotten it finished. Hmm. Anyone feel like that? You are
worthy of being healed, so you might as well get on with it. The Kingdom
<em>needs</em> you to be healed.</p>

<p>Will you know when it is completed? Here’s the rub: <em>when in Truth
healing has been</em> <em>completed, you won’t even care</em> if it’s been
completed because your life will become, we will use the word here,
sacrificed—but I don’t mean it in your normal sense of loss. It is a
gift given freely by you. It is like looking at your brothers and
sisters and saying,</p>

<p>Gosh, they sure are enjoying groveling in the muck and mire. Because I
love them I am going to get down on my hands and knees and grovel, too.
And just maybe one of them will look at me, and if they look at me at
the right time, the Holy Spirit might be able to work through me. But
the Holy Spirit will never be able to work through me if I don’t get
down on my hands and knees.</p>

<p>Enlightenment, salvation, is not about keeping the mud off of your
knees. It is the freedom to be in the mud without identifying with it,
but allowing yourself to be there as long as the Sonship still needs
you.</p>

<p>Now, if that were not true, when I ascended to my Father I would have
waved goodbye and I would have wished you well, but you would have never
heard from me again.</p>

<p>Understand what I mean when I say that I have never really left this
world and that I work without ceasing. I can only do so because I
completed my part in the atonement as a man who walked upon this plane.
Therefore, that is the path you, too, must take: to let yourself
complete the process of healing, so that out of your freedom you can
take on the cloaks of this world and look like everybody else until
<em>they</em> learn that they are not separate from God.</p>

<p>I am only a temporary mediation-bringer to you, and the grandest of days
that will come to me is when you look past me and need me no longer. But
until that day I will work without ceasing because I love you. And every
genuine healer understands the Heart from which those words are spoken,
because they are spoken from the Heart of Christ. That is more than any
one embodiment could ever contain. I am merely one who is like you but
has become identified with the Christ, and I call you to do the same.</p>

<p>The water is fine. Jump in. But to jump in, you see, you have to remove
your bathing suit of your wounds that you have refused to embrace so
that they might be healed. There can’t be any dust on your body when you
jump into the water of eternity.</p>

<p>So many of you are standing on the platform constantly repeating that
prayer,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Holy Father, let there be Light. However, I want to keep this little
smudge on myself. I want to hold on to it as my own because I put a
lot of energy into creating it. My God, I’ve spent lifetimes becoming
as wretched as I could be and now You want me to let it go? I’ve spent
lifetimes convincing myself that I am weak and frail and now You want
me to let it go? How dare You. I have used the power You have given
me, Father, to create unlike You and I have been rather proud of it. I
have even created the sense that I am separate from You and that took
a lot of doing. And now, You want me to let it go before I jump into
that lake of eternity?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, yes.</p>

<p>Let your life be a sacrifice. Not a painful sacrifice—that’s been done a
thousand times. It is not a lot of fun. Let your life be a sacrifice in
the sense that you realize that you are just walking around pretending
like you are a body, pretending like you are just a person so that you
can make yourself available to those who still believe they need an
intermediary.</p>

<p>A teacher of God is nothing but a temporary device. Please, I beg of
you, contemplate well what I have shared with you. It is very important
because it is really the journey of everyone, not just a special class
of species that are called “healers.” You are all healers, every one of
you. Learn all you can about it. Apply it to yourself. Become one who
loves to heal, not by groveling in your past, but just by noticing the
nuances that come when certain circumstances seem to elicit reactions.
Don’t pretend it isn’t happening or it will only continue. And that one
veil, though subtle as it may seem, may be the very veil that keeps you
eternally on the wheel of birth and death in the drama of separation.</p>

<p>If you want to see the planet healed, then be very fervently involved in
your own healing. Not by picking yourself up by your bootstraps, but by
asking for help and noticing what comes into your life. It’s there for a
reason. If indeed nothing arises by accident, then it must be there for
a reason.</p>

<p>Now, does that mean that you need to take upon yourself great humility
and seriousness, and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>God, I’m such a wretched, sinful creature after all and I’ve been
fooling myself. I have got to dig deep. Boy, do I have work to do.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it means to embrace it and move into healing with joy and with
strength and with certainty. Have fun with it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Have you ever spent an hour seeing how deeply you can cry? It has
been said by another teacher that some of you are familiar with, that
every tear releases a thousand years.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, what would one hour of true gut-wrenching crying do?</p>

<p>Get into it, because just the other side of those tears, divine laughter
comes. Some of you have experienced that—when you are truly into it,
something seems to shift. Anybody experience that?</p>

<p>Then, why would you fear tears? Why would you fear what you have been
taught to perceive as gut-wrenching <em>pain</em>? That is just an illusion of
perception. When the body shakes with tears, you have been taught to
believe it is because you are weak and wretched. Those that can allow
tears exhibit great strength.</p>

<p>I hope it all makes sense. Some of you in this room while I have been
speaking about this, rather forcefully, have felt a little contraction
like,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oh, God, do I really have to do this?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. And your delight rests just on the other side of doing it. When you
are in pain, don’t deny it. Own it. It does not mean that you take on
the perception that you are anything other than Christ. Even in your
pain, even if memories are coming up, you can still keep your attention
on the Light of Christ and bring that Light to it without blocking it,
without cutting it off. It is indeed most empowering to know and to
experience that you can be wailing and at the very same moment directing
the healing Light of Christ right into the wailings, because those
wailings are lifting the lid; and what’s bubbling up out of it can then
be healed by the Light that is coming to it.</p>

<p>The healer is just one that helps to do that for you until you figure
out that you can do it for yourself. And a genuine healer will always
rejoice when they perceive and see,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Thank God, they don’t need me any longer. Now I can go on to the next
person.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I know that was all of a bit of a lengthy greeting but sometimes
it’s necessary. I love you. I love you so much that I gave my life for
you. Will you love yourself with that intensity that you are willing to
lay down your life for yourself? Because <em>you</em> are worth it.</p>

<p>Jeshua?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Well, I was crying today in the presence of a friend but I felt myself
holding back because I felt that this person was uncomfortable with it.
And it seems to happen more often that way.</p>

<p>Precious friend, if you hold back the process of those tears because you
sense that the other is uncomfortable, what you are really choosing to
say is that their perceptions hold more reality than yours and you must
acquiesce and conform yourself to them. That person who seems to resist
the tears of a friend may actually need you to truly let the power of
your tears come out—so that they learn that they don’t have to be
uncomfortable with one who is releasing and healing, that they have the
strength to be present.</p>

<p>Never hold back your tears. Never hold the belief that someone else’s
need to resist those tears and to be uncomfortable with yours . . .
never hold the perception that their insanity is more important that
your healing. That is to take power away from yourself.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, first, in such a situation really let them come out, and
if that one is so uncomfortable that they have to leave you, send them
love and go find another friend until you find one that can be with you.
That’s only claiming what you are worth. And until you claim what you
are worth, your healing can’t truly come to its completion.</p>

<p>Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>Yes, I hope I can remember that.</p>

<p>Will you choose to remember it?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Good. That makes all the difference: not that you hope, but that you
choose with all of your power to always remember that you have a right
to be healed. You don’t know the hour or the day when these things are
going to be released. But allow them, because when you hold back in
order to be conformed to the perceptions of another, you are denying
yourself the opportunity to be rid of who-knows-what that may have been
held for an awfully long time. And when will the conditions arise again
that allow that opportunity to be handed to you?</p>

<p>Know you that saying, “Seize the day?”</p>

<p>Yes, the opportunity.</p>

<p>Yes. Time is given to you so that you learn to use it constructively.
And if there is a shadow or weight upon the heart and an opportunity
comes, through time, for you to release it and you don’t take advantage
of it, have you used time constructively?</p>

<p>Many in your world have learned to use a simple device to avoid healing.
It has usually a little knob on it, and you turn it and a bunch of
little dots create images on the screen. You know what I am talking
about? How many times have you when you have been feeling alone, a
little depressed, a little sad and confused, how many times have you
turned it on? Or sought other ways to distract yourself?</p>

<p>That is not a very constructive use of time, and it only ensures that
you are going to have to face certain conditions that must arise and to
prod that stuff up again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am going to shove it back down, turn on the television, or find
some other distraction.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, is one of the purposes of “special” relationships to stuff our
guilt?</p>

<p>Yes, “special” relationships are rather interesting. Most of the time
the ego will convince you that you are really looking for that one
heartfelt relationship when indeed what you are really doing is looking
for someone who can play your game with you and keep you from truly
getting on with it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Ah, we are going to have so much fun. We’ll do this and this and that
and that.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there is nothing wrong with having fun, but a special relationship
is actually designed by the ego to serve the ego, and you all know what
that means.</p>

<p>A holy relationship is founded within two souls that have chosen to come
together because they are sick and tired of not getting on with it. They
don’t come together to drown themselves out with all the devices of
distraction of the world. They come together and are willing to allow
the uniting of their energies to bring it all up and get rid of it. A
holy relationship is for healing and service, not for satisfying egos.</p>

<p>A holy relationship is what you can offer your brother or sister every
time you see them, if you would but first make the choice within
yourself not to use them to fill you, certainly not to use them so that
you can hold on to opinions and judgments, but to be with them openly
and honestly and completely. And if they choose to be with you in the
same way, you indeed experience a Holy Instant. And no matter what seems
to have been going on, there is a feeling of peace that comes, and the
value of that encounter makes it timeless and eternal and precious, and
it will always be remembered because ultimately the Son of God will
remember only loving thoughts.</p>

<p>Holy relationship is everything in the real world. Special relationships
are everything in the unreal world that you have created in error.</p>

<p>Choose then, choose to be one so humbled by this vast journey that all
you want is holy relationship—not relationship that serves you or
gratifies you, but relationship through which the Holy Spirit can awaken
both you and your brother or sister right where you are, so that you can
experience that Holy Instant of perfect sacred intimacy in which you
have looked beyond all illusions and have seen the equality of the Love
of Christ in the one before you, and therefore have recognized it in
yourself.</p>

<p>The habit of special relationships runs deep and it needs to be
interrupted constantly. When you go to see your brother or sister, take
just a moment and pause,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Why am I really doing this? Is it out of distraction? Is there
something I am trying to
glean from them? Can I choose to just be with them, to love them? And
to open the place in me so that their love can be received, to create
the opportunity for the Holy Instant?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When a master walks upon this Earth—and they have many names and many of
you know of many masters—what is it, what is it in them that leads those
that follow them, or their disciples, or their friends, or those that
study with them, to feel such depth of gratitude? Is it their teaching?
That helps. But what it is truly is that a master always looks through
the eyes of Christ and extends the opportunity for a Holy Instant to
everyone that he contacts or she contacts. And what makes the master
loved by the student (to use that term) is that the student has
experienced an instant in which they, too, chose to see the master
through the eyes of Christ and there was an experience of a Holy
Instant.</p>

<p>Now, initially they will think the master did a grand thing for them.
Eventually they will learn that it was their power, too, and their
choice to join in sacred intimacy.</p>

<p>Practice, then, being masters. Not because you believe you are, but
because you have the power to do so. Make a little game of it. When you
rest your head on your pillow at the end of your day, go back over your
day and count the times you remembered to enter into encounters—or
relationships, because every encounter is relationship— how many times
did you do so from the standpoint of holiness? And how many times did
you forget?</p>

<p>At first you will be rather amazed how small the count is, but it will
grow as you practice it. You have simply practiced forgetting holiness;
and if you have therefore learned specialness, you can unlearn it. Time
is given to you that you might learn to use it constructively. And yet,
still, so many of you that have heard this same message for a year are
allowing many of your days to go by in unconsciousness. Why? Why would
you want to continue doing it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well… habit.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holy relationship is everything, and you are the one who can bring it
and give it to your brother and your sister. Now, the mind will tell you
that there seems to be a dichotomy here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>How can I be involved with healing and yet extend holy relationship?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contemplate it because they work together perfectly. The one who is
truly open to healing and who will hold on to no dark shadow within
them, one who is willing to spend the rest of their incarnation allowing
healing to occur is one who already has the power to extend the
opportunity for holy relationship because there is no pretense left in
them.</p>

<p>Makes sense?</p>

<p>So, have a lot of fun getting together with your friends and talking
about your healing journeys and how many times you have extended the
opportunity for holy relationship. See, masters can get together and can
have a great time rejoicing at all the times they blow it. Hmm.</p>

<p>False holiness says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am perfect and I am healed.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>True holiness says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oh, my goodness gracious, did I blow that one today. Yikes! Father, I
still need Your help.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>False holiness says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’ve got it all figured out now, Father. Goodbye.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>True holiness says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Of myself I do nothing but the Father through me does all things.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It requires a lot of humility of seeing that you’ve never been able to
heal yourself. You don’t know what a single thing is for and none of
your perceptions have ever been wholly true. So why cling to them?</p>

<p>And when an insight comes for a moment and you extend it to your brother
or sister, you might as well let go of it, because you don’t really know
where it came from. You don’t know the purpose it’s going to serve, and
you can never be sure of it. But the Holy Spirit knows how to use it.</p>

<p>Do you know how to recognize a false teacher or a false healer?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, I see that you’ve got this real serious problem here and I can
fix it here, and oh, yes…</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And tomorrow they will still remember telling you those things because
they need to cling to their perception of themselves as a healer. A
genuine healer allows healing to be done and whatever happens, happens;
and then it is gone, so that they are empty and ready for the next
opportunity. And they <em>never allow the insights to come from
crystallized pictures or metaphysical beliefs about how the universe is
structured.</em> That takes great arrogance.</p>

<p>Once I said to you that certain words that seem to come through me and
have been written down a million times called the Sermon on the Mount, I
said unto you that when those words poured through me, when that hour
was over and certain of my friends said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Boy, you were really on,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said to them,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What did I say?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t even remember it and I couldn’t have cared less. I was moving
on to the next moment in which I might have an opportunity to extend a
chance for holy relationship, and that is all.</p>

<p>Be, therefore, healers of the world by clinging to nothing, not even
your old wounds and your old pain, and certainly never cling to the
belief that you have got it all together. You are here to take on the
form of your brothers and sisters who are groveling in the muck and mire
of false perceptions, to take on the appearance so that they can look
upon you as one of their own, and you never know how the Spirit will
work through you. And when it’s done, it’s done. Let it go. Release the
illusion that to awaken means that you get to go somewhere else and
never get your hands dirty again. It’s just the opposite.</p>

<p>How will you know, then, when you are truly awake? When you can’t wait
to find ways to serve and to be available always to serve your brother
and sister. When you cry out to God,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Give me more opportunities. I’m dying sitting here in my living
room.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you’ll know you have really begun to awaken.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Bring them to me, Father. I don’t care. I know I can do this. I’ll
just be there. Bring them to me. You can do it all through me. I know
you can. Bring them to me. What avenues can I use to heal this world?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing, of course, that you are not the healer; you are just the
messenger. Then you will know that you have really awakened.</p>

<p>When you don’t care if you are exhausted every day, when you no longer
care whether your ego is being gratified, when you no longer care about
anything but finding ways to help others heal and being available to do
it, and if the Holy Spirit says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Get on a plane and go here for one day and then get on another plane
and travel halfway across the world to another place, and you will
only see one client.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>—and you know that that is perfect, then you will know that a miracle
has been worked through you and has happened to you.</p>

<p>I have said that awakening comes as a thief in the night, stealing the
cobwebs of shadows outgrown. And I have also said that salvation comes
by your extending love to your brother and sister because <em>salvation can
only be realized by sharing it.</em> Therefore, when you find yourself so
passionately involved in not being able to do anything but find someone
to extend love to, whatever modalities seem to work, and when you see
miracles happening in others, then when you rest your head on the
pillow, you will be able to remember that the thief has come in the
night and begun to steal your own cobwebs, because if miracles are
worked through you, they must have occurred to you. And then you will
give thanks, and you will laugh and rejoice at how healing truly occurs.
Indeed.</p>

<p>Precious friends, if I come and blend with the mind and body of this my
beloved brother—who finally got so sick and tired of trying to figure it
out that he just threw his hands up in the air and said, “What the hell.
I don’t understand it. You do it.”—if by coming for these three short
years, just one of you hears something or receives something that moves
you one inch, it will have been a work well served, because when any one
of you moves just a smidgen, you will have uplifted the whole of
creation. And that is powerful indeed. That is a miracle. And ultimately
again you will come to see that your choice for healing, the ability to
take the risk for healing, comes from the power of the Christ in you
because you always awaken to your own call. You have been calling to
yourself. Hear your call and allow it. And in that alone you are already
the Light of the world.</p>

<p>Now, if you really understand all of that, then, you see, there is no
more time for frowns upon the face, heaviness upon the shoulders. Now,
you may experience those as you are releasing and allowing healing to
occur, but the rest of the time you are going to be singing and dancing
because you are going to see that you are healing out of the power of
Christ Himself. And if you are healing out of the power of Christ, you
can rest assured that the end is inevitable. But as long as you try to
heal out of your smallness, the end is not inevitable. <em>Claim the power
of Christ as yourself and open to your healing and allow it</em>.</p>

<p>And then sing and dance and play because you have finally figured out
there is nothing else to do and isn’t it great? All of those demons are
just little pussy cats. You might as well pet them.</p>

<p>Jeshua?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>I am listening to you say “of the world” and “in the world” and I have a
memory of that written in the Bible, and I also am sensing that when
that was spoken, it is resonating something in me that I am not aware of
why. But it is important to me to ask this question.</p>

<p>Beloved friend, I want you to first understand that often what I talk
about in these groups, while of course it is for everyone in general, it
is often given specifically for one or two or five who are at a certain
place in their journey, and certain words are going to resonate as an
energy that gets things moving. I am not here going to address with
words the answer to your question, but I am going to ask you to keep
that feeling that you noticed, and as you rest your head on your pillow,
ask yourself the question you just asked me—not with a rigidity of mind,
but with a relaxed body and heart, letting the angel of air move deeply
through the body. Ask, not trying to hear the answer, but to feel it,
because what is at work here is not a concept at all. There is an energy
at work that you have allowed to touch your soul, and it is going to
release and heal something that you have held on to for some time.
Willing to do that?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Do you think it will be worth it?</p>

<p>Everything so far is.</p>

<p>Ah, thank you.</p>

<p>Even when l am over my head.</p>

<p>Count it as a blessing when you think you are over your head, because
you will stop trying to grasp it with the mind and you will begin to
allow it with the heart.</p>

<p>Thank you for you.</p>

<p>Thank you for you.</p>

<p>You are welcome.</p>

<p>And thank you for your “Thank you.”</p>

<p>It’s actually a lot of fun to sit down with a friend and just do that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Thank you for you. Thank you for you.</em></p>

  <p><em>Thank you for your thank you. Thank you for your thank you.</em></p>

  <p><em>Thank you for your thank you, thank you.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spend an hour doing that.</p>

<p>Jeshua, I want to thank you for something. Two and a half days ago I
found myself in a situation that I found very, very painful and
confusing and upsetting. It took me until today and with a little help
from Jon Marc to sort things out; and once they were sorted out I was
really elated all afternoon, like a great weight had been lifted off my
shoulders. And then I found, driving over here tonight, that I was
getting depressed because I was disappointed that it took me so long to
practice what you have been teaching. But while I have been sitting here
listening to you tonight, I definitely got the message that I– and we–
need to be patient with ourselves So that’s something that I heard from
you that has put me back in a relaxed state.</p>

<p>I am sorry to have affected your tension!</p>

<p>So, precious friend, indeed, be patient. As I have shared with you, I
learned from the lips of a very holy teacher that I worked with when I
was a child. Some of you are aware of this one who is named in certain
ancient scripts, called the Teacher of Righteousness. The Teacher of
Righteousness was never born of a woman but manifested a physical form
to serve as a teacher. And one thing he said to me always remained with
me. He said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Jeshua ben Joseph, patience is to make power slowly and certainly.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So don’t be impatient. You are worth the best you can offer yourself.
Therefore, be patient with yourself. Now, on your way over here, yes,
you decided to whip yourself.</p>

<p>Right. That’s so right.</p>

<p>When you notice you are whipping yourself, go,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Ah yes, there I am whipping myself. That’s a beautiful one.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then embrace it and love it and it will fade away because the Holy
Spirit will come as the thief and will steal that cobweb from you and
you won’t even notice it until you look back and it will have been a
week or two or three, six months or a year, and you will say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Gosh, I haven’t really whipped myself since, I can’t even remember
when. Where did it go?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A little miracle.</p>

<p>That will be wonderful.</p>

<p>Not that that will <em>be</em> wonderful. It <em>is</em> wonderful.</p>

<p>That’s in the present tense.</p>

<p>Yes. So, how are we all doing?</p>

<p>Fine. Good.</p>

<p>Thank you for allowing me to deliver that message. It was rather
important, in some degree for all of you, but specifically for just a
handful because of some things that are going on in your own processes.</p>

<p>Jeshua, would you repeat one more time what your teacher told you to
do—build something slowly?</p>

<p>Beloved friend, I don’t have time.</p>

<p>Well, actually that’s true: I don’t have <em>any</em> time.</p>

<p>Patience is to make power slowly and certainly.</p>

<p>The grandest of your artists have never hurried through their creations.
And you are a great creation indeed, worthy of meticulous reshaping.</p>

<p>You see, <em>when you have truly learned to master time—to use it
constructively always—time ceases for you</em> even if others perceive
that the same body and personality is still dwelling in it. For you it
has ceased. And when time ceases, all of the long journey and all of
the wounds and all of the heaviness is gone. It’s a rather nice feeling,
by the way. But, paradoxically, then you become totally free to do what
has been called, in your Christian terminology “to take on the sins of
the world”—that is to take on the appearance of time and to be in it as
long as it takes for the whole of the Sonship to have mastered the
constructive use of time.</p>

<p>On the constructive use of time… When I told you that I had a chance
to go and stay at a friend’s home on a beautiful lake, you recommended
that I go, even though I had free will and could choose to do what
whatever. And I chose to go, and at the time I was asking you about it,
you cautioned me to use my time wisely. Now, I have been up there for
the better part of two weeks, with two trips to town, and I am learning
that I am not quite sure what to do with time. I have always had so many
things to do with time, it feels very strange. I don’t know if I need to
kind of structure my time. I think I have a tendency to do that too much
and yet, when I just sort of hang out, l am a little uncomfortable with
that. What do you think I should do?</p>

<p>Does it matter?</p>

<p>Well, I would like to make lots of progress, more or less.</p>

<p>Then, do so. But understand, precious friend, that you hold the power in
every moment to stop the whirlings of the mind, to set them aside and
say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Holy Spirit, what is the most constructive use of time that I can now
employ?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He will not hide it from you. For when you want specific answers, the
Holy Spirit will give them.</p>

<p>For me to say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, the constructive use of time would be not to structure it at
all,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>would not be wholly true. And if I said unto you,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The constructive use of time is to structure all of it,</em></p>

  <p>that would not be wholly true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The constructive use of time requires your decision to turn to the one
Teacher Whose guidance is always unerring, and to trust what you hear.
Although you may not hear words, you might have a feeling or an
intuition. That is the constructive use of time.</p>

<p>What other use is there?</p>

<p>Ah, you’ve let the cat out of the bag.</p>

<p>I keep thinking I should hear a voice within myself.</p>

<p>Ah. Coming from the clouds of Heaven?</p>

<p>Well, at least something that is distinctly other than me.</p>

<p>Beloved friend, that is the illusion of separation.</p>

<p>I have been having such a problem with that. Sometimes it’s good to say
things out loud just to hear how erroneous it sounds.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is closer to you than your own breath. Now, it is
important…</p>

<p>It is what you know in your deepest heart.</p>

<p>Your deepest heart <em>is</em> the union of the Father and Son.</p>

<p>I’ve got it!</p>

<p>Ah.</p>

<p>Now, some of you that can see energies that are not usually seen with
the physical eyes, if you were watching in that moment, you saw a shift
in the change of the color of light around this one, and what you saw
would or could be perceived or described as the weight of a thousand
lifetimes being lifted. Now we will find out if she lets it remain
there.</p>

<p>Oh, I want to. I will.</p>

<p>Know that I love you always and I come always as your servant. I can’t
be anything else. I simply can’t be anything else, and I don’t want to
be. I love you and I will love you until the whole of the Sonship has
its “Aha.” And those of you that choose to join with me, and understand
that because I am your friend and your brother, in whatever way you
choose to serve, all you have to do is ask and I will come running. When
you open the door, I will join with you and together we will assist our
brothers and sisters in their own process of awakening. I am available
to any of you all of the time. Some of you know that.</p>

<p>Peace be unto you and we will see you soon. Amen.</p>

<p>Beloved friends, what is in Truth the whole heart and essence of
healing?</p>

<p>To share with one another from a point of equality, of seeing no one as
above you and no one as below you, and seeing not yourself as more
perfect than another. But to see that you <em>are</em> one another, and to
realize that it is in the sharing of your journey, the willingness to
listen and to love, that brings healing to the heart and to the soul.
And forever the soul, which is the Son of God, is one. Though there be
many bodies and personalities attached, you are but one Mind and one
Heart. And when you choose to join together, you have chosen the
creation of holy relationship, and even in these few moments you have
extended the Holy Instant unto one another.</p>

<p>Therefore, always remember that there is but one thing taking place: the
awakening of the holy Son of God—or Daughter, if you prefer. It makes
little difference; it’s all words. But you are that one, and the
language that I use is used only as a point of identification so that
you can recognize me.</p>

<p>Beloved and holy Son of God, great is my love for you, for indeed you
are already all that I am. Therefore, the one known as Jeshua, that
which I am that came and walked among you, could be no other but
yourself. The entire drama is yours and there is nothing outside of you.
Every pain felt by a brother or sister is your pain, and it is only
through your extension of love that you can heal yourself of that pain.
To judge another’s pain or another’s thought or another’s behavior is to
ensure that it will continue within <em>you</em>. Perhaps in a different form,
but it will continue. Therefore, indeed, it is only love that heals. It
is love that I am and it is love that you are. Everything else is the
result of an illusion and a mistaken perception.</p>

<p>That is why a master greets anger with love. That is why a master greets
attack with love. For when you believe you are attacked and therefore
become defensive, you have asserted with the power of Christ that attack
is real, and you have made sure that you will continue to experience
attack.</p>

<p>Meet all things with love. Greet all things with love. See in the eye of
even a blade of grass, yourself. Indeed, I am the holy Son of God given
to the world of my Father because He loves you. Where have I come from?
The Heart of God. Where have you come from? The Heart of God. We are one
and the same.</p>

<p>Therefore, when I come forth and create a demonstration or an appearance
of being Jeshua ben Joseph, it is only to animate a physical form
because you have believed yourself to be the body, to teach you that you
are Spirit and that you are One. The only reality that in Truth can be,
is that the holy Son of God is one, united always with all that God is.
And salvation is complete on Earth as it is in Heaven when the Sonship
awakens to the Truth of its reality.</p>

<p>That is why I have asked you to join with me to extend the Kingdom to
your brother and to your sister. And when you see them in error or in
pain, embrace them. Offer them through holy relationship the opportunity
for the Holy Instant that heals all things. You are the ones; you are
the bringers of Light into this world.</p>

<p>I ask you only to let me walk with you. And what does that mean but to
recognize that the heart and essence of your being <em>is</em> Jeshua <em>is</em>
Christ <em>is</em> the offspring of Light divine by whatever name you choose
to call it. God is Love and therefore I love you. You are the Grace of
God in form. That is who you are. Embrace your brother and your sister.
Embrace them with all of your being, not just your mind, not just your
heart. Use the arms your Holy Mother has given you.</p>

<p>I am going to ask each and every one of you this week in each of your
days to call someone you haven’t spoken with lately and tell them how
much you appreciate their being, because their being in your life has
been serving your awakening. Let them know from the bottom of your heart
how much you love them for that. Encourage them to be the Truth of who
they are and to never deviate from listening to the voice of Spirit that
speaks not in the mind of the ego, but in the quietness and the
gentleness of the heart. Encourage them to follow the path that they
feel they must follow, because there is a reason for it. And the reason
serves the atonement of the Sonship.</p>

<p>Indeed, if you could look through the eyes of the Christ—and, of course,
you can because that’s who you are—and you would never again lament
anything that unfolds in your experience or your drama because you would
see the exquisite perfection that those moments are serving. Nothing
happens by accident and not one of you holds an experience in isolation
from the whole of the Sonship. Everything you taste and feel and think
and experience is felt and touches the entire community of Christ the
Sonship. Everything.</p>

<p>Love every moment that comes to you. Embrace it and honor it. If it
means that you cry a thousand tears, then let your tears be a way in
which you honor that moment. And if your brother or sister is in pain,
embrace them. Don’t tell them,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Why are you doing this? You are creating your own reality.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is nonsense and it is hurtful. For well have I seen that idea being
misused in your metaphysical circles. When your brother and sister is in
pain, embrace them and feel it with them and allow it to be felt by
them. When they are ready to think about it, you will know. Let them
feel it. Tell them you know what it feels like. It is called empathy,
not judgment.</p>

<p>Ah, beloved and holy child of God, you are one with me. You are one with
me. Embrace me. Claim me as the reality of your own being. Claim me.
Will I disappear from you? No. I am your brother and I am your friend
and I am all that you are, and I choose to be what you are in the
fullness that you have yet, for a little while, chosen to resist; and I
will never cease in coming to you, because I love you, until finally you
decide it’s time.  Then all healing will occur, and you will be brought
rapidly through miracle after miracle after miracle to swiftly be all
that I represent to mankind.</p>

<p>You shall be the worker of miracles. And that is given unto you even
now. And in this hour as I stood nearby, and stood in the midst of you,
you extended miracles one unto another, because in this hour and in this
place you have come and you choose to set aside the perceptions taught
you of your world that are wholly insane, and you choose to come
together to allow love to heal.</p>

<p>And if not a word is said to you in the whole hour or the whole evening
and you would sit there quietly, understand that you participate
actively in the healing of every mind and every heart that chooses to
come to these gatherings. That is how powerful you are and how precious
your presence is. You can be on the floor with your best friend and
still be involved in the healing of every mind and heart. Therefore,
when another is speaking, let not the mind wander, but just sit there
and embrace them with love. Miracles happen naturally and effortlessly
to minds and hearts that choose only love.</p>

<p>Love and judgment can never abide in the same moment. Love is of the
Kingdom; judgment is of hell. What will your choice be? You are the
Light of the world. You <em>are</em> the Light of the world. <em>You are the Light
of this world</em>, and it needs it so desperately.</p>

<p>Be love. Teach love. And therefore you will learn that you are love.
Don’t just expect miracles. Know that you are the one that is sent to
allow miracles to be given through you. It just happens when you choose
to love.</p>

<p>Short is the time that is given me to join with you in this rather
unusual way. And when I walked upon this plane, I would have never
guessed that I would be doing this work with this, my beloved brother.
My Father hadn’t let me in on it yet. It’s probably a good thing He
didn’t. Hmm. Can you know what is around the corner for you? Do you need
to know? The mind that is fearful looks ahead and wonders. The mind that
is awake lives in this moment and it is enough, because that mind knows
that it is sustained by the Love of God, and if it is true in this
moment, it certainly won’t change in the next.</p>

<p>Be at peace, then, in all things and give no thought for tomorrow, what
you shall eat and what you shall wear and what career you might have
five years from now. But own the presence of Love now and the future
will very easily take care of itself. And you shall be more then than
you think you are today.</p>

<p>I love you. Please do me but one favor: love your brothers and sisters,
though you don’t even know their names, as you believe I have loved you.
And if you have felt that love, <em>please give it away</em>. In so doing you
have honored the Son that dwells within you, and by honoring the Son
that dwells in you, you have indeed honored me, and I give thanks for
every moment you choose to extend your love to another.</p>

<p>I shall never leave you; and when this brief work is done, think not
that I will go away from you. But I call you to quicken your choice to
hear me and to abide with me always as your friend and as your brother.</p>

<p>I love you and I want you to be my friend. And even though you are in a
body, think not that that body can be an obstacle to our communion, our
communication and our celebration that we are as our Father has created
us to be: the Thought of perfect Love in form. And if you seem to have
the form of a body while I seem not to, what difference does it make?</p>

<p>There are no obstacles to minds that join in love. Forgive your brother
and sister. Forgive yourself for ever having thought that you were
separate one from another, that the world was a place in which you
needed to be fearful. For perfect love casts out fear, which has been
your only enemy. Fear blocks the knowledge of the Kingdom. Let that
perfect Love, therefore, be in you, even as it is in me, given to you.</p>

<p>I love you, holy Son of God. Pray not to die, but to live eternally and
to let your Light heal this world. Give your love away and you will
never be without it. Peace be unto you. Peace be unto the only begotten
offspring of God, created changeless and perfect. That is who you are.
And let that power of that perfection heal every illusion ever held
within your mind and in your emotions and in your body. Honor your Holy
Mother by letting that healing come to the cells of your body. Hmm.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, that indeed the Kingdom of Heaven might be wed with the
Kingdom of this Earth, that Spirit and matter might be united as one and
the love of Christ be extended as far as from the East unto the West,
until it embraces the whole of the creation and <em>all</em> of us return home
as one. Give your peace away and you will <em>never</em> lose it.</p>

<p>And what I said will eternally remain true: I am with you always. I can
hardly be anywhere else. I love you, and I thank you for being willing
to entertain the thought that just maybe Jeshua can borrow a body and a
mind long enough to communicate with words.</p>

<p>But unto each and every one of you—and I speak of when you return to
your abodes and rest your head upon your pillow—<em>I will come</em> to each
and every one of you. Will you open the door and allow me in?</p>

<p>Peace be unto you. Remember, call someone each day of your following
week that you haven’t spoken with for a while and share from your heart
what I have asked you to share. You don’t have to. Don’t do it
begrudgingly. Do it with a lot of lightness and fun. Get into feeling
how powerful the love is that is in you that longs to be given away, and
it will transform the whole of your week.</p>

<p>Yet a little while and I will be with you no more. Cherish, then, these
few moments given us, for when the form of this work is gone, it is
gone. But I hope you will have used it as a bridge to come wholly to
where I am, for I wait to truly embrace you without an inch of distance
between us. Yet we shall work together to serve the atonement of the
Sonship. We shall love every brother and sister that the Holy Spirit
brings to us, and though you may not yet see the form of the work you
will be doing, it will be revealed to you.</p>

<p>And I will join with you as your friend and your brother, and
together—as one—we shall embrace the whole of creation and offer it, on
the platter of the awakened Heart of Christ, back to the Father. What
else is there to do?</p>

<p>Peace be unto you.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
