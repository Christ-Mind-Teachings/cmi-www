    <p class="omit"><a class="hide-review" href="/workbook/l204/#l184">Review</a></p>

<p>You live by symbols. You have made up names for everything you see. Each
one becomes a separate entity, identified by its own name. By this you
carve it out of unity. By this you designate its special attributes, and
set it off from other things by emphasizing space surrounding it. This
space you lay between all things to which you give a different name; all
happenings in terms of place and time; all bodies which are greeted by a
name.</p>

<p>This space you see as setting off all things from one another is the
means by which the world’s perception is achieved. You see something
where nothing is, and see as well nothing where there is unity; a space
between all things, between all things and you. Thus do you think that
you have given life in separation. By this split you think you are
established as a unity which functions with an independent will.</p>

<p>What are these names by which the world becomes a series of discrete
events, of things ununified, of bodies kept apart and holding bits of
mind as separate awarenesses? You gave these names to them, establishing
perception as you wished to have perception be. The nameless things were
given names, and thus reality was given them as well. For what is named
is given meaning, and will then be seen as meaningful, a cause of true
effects, with consequence inherent in itself.</p>

<p>This is the way reality is made by partial vision, purposefully set
against the given truth. Its enemy is wholeness. It conceives of little
things, and looks upon them. And a lack of space, a sense of unity or
vision which sees differently become the threats which it must overcome,
conflict with and deny.</p>

<p>Yet does this other vision still remain a natural direction for the mind
to channel its perception. It is hard to teach the mind a thousand alien
names and thousands more. Yet you believe this is what learning means;
its one essential goal by which communication is achieved and concepts
can be meaningfully shared.</p>

<p>This is the sum of the inheritance the world bestows. And everyone who
learns to think that it is so accepts the signs and
symbols which assert the world is real. It is for this they stand. They
leave no doubt that what is named is there. It can be seen, as is
anticipated. What denies that it is false is but illusion, for it is the
ultimate reality. To question it is madness; to accept its presence is
the proof of sanity.</p>

<p>Such is the teaching of the world. It is a phase of learning everyone
who comes must go through. But the sooner he perceives on what it rests,
how questionable are its premises, how doubtful its results, the sooner
does he question its effects. Learning which stops with what the world
would teach stops short of meaning. In its proper place, it serves but
as a starting point from which another kind of learning can begin, a new
perception can be gained, and all the arbitrary names the world bestows
can be withdrawn as they are raised to doubt.</p>

<p>Think not you made the world. Illusions, yes! But what is true in earth
and Heaven is beyond your naming. When you call upon a brother, it is to
his body that you make appeal. His true identity is hidden from you by
what you believe he really is. His body makes response to what you call
him, for his mind consents to take the name you give him as his own. And
thus his unity is twice denied, for you perceive him separate from you,
and he accepts this separate name as his.</p>

<p>It would indeed be strange if you were asked to go beyond all symbols of
the world, forgetting them forever; yet were asked to take a teaching
function. You have need to use the symbols of the world a while. But be
you not deceived by them as well. They do not stand for anything at all,
and in your practicing it is this thought that will release you from
them. They become but means by which you can communicate in ways the
world can understand, but which you recognize is not the unity where
true communication can be found.</p>

<p>Thus what you need are intervals each day in which the learning of the
world becomes a transitory phase; a prison house from which you go into
the sunlight and forget the darkness. Here you understand the Word, the
Name Which God has given you; the One Identity Which all things share;
the one acknowledgment of what is true. And then step back to darkness,
not because you think it real, but only to proclaim its unreality in
terms which still have meaning in the world which darkness rules.</p>

<p>Use all the little names and symbols which delineate the world of
darkness. Yet accept them not as your reality. The Holy Spirit uses all
of them, but He does not forget creation has One Name, One Meaning, and
a single Source Which unifies all things within Itself. Use all the
names the world bestows on them but for convenience, yet do not forget
they share the Name of God along with you.</p>

<p>God has no name. And yet His Name becomes the final lesson that all
things are one, and at this lesson does all learning end. All names are
unified; all space is filled with truth’s reflection. Every gap is
closed, and separation healed. The Name of God is the inheritance He gave
to those who chose the teaching of the world to take the place of
Heaven. In our practicing, our purpose is to let our minds accept what
He has given as the answer to the pitiful inheritance you made as
fitting tribute to the Son He loves.</p>

<p>No-one can fail who seeks the meaning of the Name of God. Experience
must come to supplement the Word. But first you must accept One Name for
all reality, and realize the many names you gave its aspects have
distorted what you see but have not interfered with truth at all. One
Name we bring into our practicing. One Name we use to unify our sight.</p>

<p>And though we use a different name for each awareness of an aspect of
God’s Son, we understand that they have but One Name, Which He has given
them. It is this Name we use in practicing. And through Its use, all
foolish separations disappear which kept us blind. And we are given
strength to see beyond them. Now our sight is blessed with blessings we
can give as we receive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Father, our Name is Yours. In It we are united with all living things
and You Who are their One Creator. What we made and call by many
different names is but a shadow we have tried to cast across Your Own
Reality. And we are glad and thankful we were wrong. All our mistakes we
give to You, that we may be absolved of all effects our errors seemed
to have. And we accept the truth You give in place of every one of
them. Your Name is our salvation and escape from what we made. Your
Name unites us in the Oneness which is our inheritance and
peace. Amen.</p>
