    <p>The first obstacle that peace must flow across is your desire to get RID
of it. For it cannot extend unless you KEEP it. You are the center from
which it radiates outward, to call the others in. You are its home; its
tranquil dwelling-place, from which it gently reaches out, but never
leaving YOU. If you would make it homeless, how can it abide within the
Son of God? If it would spread across the whole creation, it must begin
with you, and FROM you reach to everyone who calls, and bring him rest
by joining you.</p>

<p>Why would you want peace homeless? What do you think that it must
dispossess, to dwell with you? What seems to be the cost you are so
unwilling to pay? The little barrier of sand still stands between you.
Would you reinforce it NOW? You are not asked to let it go for
yourselves alone. Christ asks it of you for Himself. He would bring
peace to everyone, and how can He do this EXCEPT through you? Would you
let a little bank of sand, a wall of dust, a tiny seeming
barrier, stand between your brothers and salvation? And yet, it IS this
little remnant of attack you cherish still against each other that is
the first obstacle the peace in you encounters in its going forth. This
little wall of hatred would still oppose the Will of God, and keep It
limited.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit’s purpose rests in peace within you. Yet you are still
unwilling to let it join you wholly. You still oppose the Will of God,
just by a little. And that little is a limit you would place upon the
whole. God’s Will is One, not many. It has no opposition, for there is
none beside It. What you would still contain behind your little barrier
and keep separate from each other seems mightier than the universe, for
it would hold back the universe and its Creator. This little wall would
hide the purpose of Heaven, and keep it FROM Heaven.</p>

<p>Would you thrust salvation away from the GIVER of salvation? For such
have you become. Peace could no more depart from you than from God. Fear
not this little obstacle. It cannot contain the Will of God. Peace WILL
flow across it, and join you without hindrance. Salvation cannot BE
withheld from you. It is your PURPOSE. You CANNOT will apart from
this. You have no purpose apart from each other, nor apart from the one
you asked the Holy Spirit to share with you. The little wall will fall
away so quietly beneath the wings of peace! For peace will send its
messengers from you to all the world. And barriers will fall away before
their coming as easily as those which you would interpose will be
surmounted.</p>

<p>To overcome the world is no more difficult than to surmount your little
wall. For in the miracle of your relationship, without this barrier, is
EVERY miracle contained. There is no order of difficulty in miracles,
for they are all the SAME. Each is a gentle winning over from the appeal
of guilt to the appeal of love. How can this FAIL to be accomplished,
wherever it is undertaken? Guilt can raise no real barriers against it.
And all that seems to stand between you must fall away because of the
appeal you answered. For from you who answered, He Who answered you
would call. His home is in your holy relationship. Do not attempt to
stand between Him and His holy purpose, for it is yours. But let Him
quietly extend the miracle of your relationship to everyone contained in
it as it was given.</p>

<p>There is a hush in Heaven, a happy expectancy, a little pause of
gladness in acknowledgment of the journey’s end. For Heaven knows
you well, as you know Heaven. No illusions stand between you now. Look
not upon the little wall of shadows. The sun has risen OVER it. How can a
shadow keep you from the sun? No more can you be kept by shadows from
the light in which illusions end. Every miracle is but the end of an
illusion. Such was the journey; such its ending. And in the goal of
truth which you accepted must ALL illusions end.</p>

<p>The little, insane wish to get rid of Him Who you invited in and push
Him out MUST produce conflict. As you look upon the world, this little
wish, uprooted and floating aimlessly, can land and settle briefly upon
anything, for it HAS no purpose now. Before the Holy Spirit entered to
abide with you, it seemed to have a MIGHTY purpose; the fixed and
unchangeable dedication to sin and its results. Now it is aimless,
wandering pointlessly, causing no more than tiny interruptions in love’s
appeal.</p>

<p>This feather of a wish, this tiny illusion, this microscopic remnant of
the belief in sin, is all that remains of what once seemed to be the
world. It is no longer an unrelenting barrier to peace. Its pointless
wandering makes its results appear to be more erratic and unpredictable
than before. Yet what COULD be more unstable than a tightly-organized
delusional system? Its seeming stability is its pervasive WEAKNESS,
which extends to everything. The variability which the little remnant
induces merely indicates its limited results.</p>

<p>How mighty can a little feather be before the great wings of truth? Can
it oppose an eagle’s flight, or hinder the advance of summer? Can it
interfere with the effects of summer’s sun upon a garden covered by the
snow? See but how easily this little whisp is lifted up and carried
away, never to return, and part with it in gladness, not regret. For it
is nothing in itself, and stood for nothing when you had greater faith
in its protection. Would you not rather greet the summer sun than fix
your gaze upon a disappearing snowflake, and shiver in remembrance of
the winter’s cold?</p>
