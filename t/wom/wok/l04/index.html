    <p>Now, we begin.</p>

<p>And indeed, once again, greetings unto you, beloved and holy friends.
Understand well, then, my delight in creating communication devices that
allow me to be with <em>you</em>. Feel and understand my delight as I seek to
look upon the world in which you abide and allow myself to receive the
guidance of my Father in how I can best create communication devices
that can touch as many hearts and minds as possible.</p>

<p>There is a great advantage to living outside of the realm of the body. I
need not spend “time” on the body. And I can see that that strikes some
chords among you. The body is not right, and the body is not wrong. The
body simply is. And in Reality, as you have fallen under the spell of
the world that you have created — for no other reason than you wanted to
— you have come to perceive the body in a certain way. First of all, you
think it is quite solid when, in fact, it is not. You think that the
body separates you from others since, as your scientists well know, no
two solid objects can occupy the same point of space and time. They’re
quite right about that.</p>

<p>As you look out, then, through the eyes of the body, you would <em>actually
believe</em> that you dwell within it, and therefore, have a <em>private domain</em>
that is all yours. This leads you to the <em>great delusion</em> that you can
have <em>private thoughts</em>. Like one who comes home after a day of work and
closes the front door behind them and then rants and raves about their
boss or their co-workers, thinking that the walls of the house are
around them and that, therefore, they have something called “privacy.”
Rest assured that this is quite a delusion!</p>

<p>In reality, the body does not contain you. Rather, you contain the body.
<em>Mind</em> is vast, eternal, and unlimited. <em>Mind</em> is what every being that you
know participates in, like waves participating in the ocean. This means
that anytime you think a thought about anyone, that thought is
communicated to them. Now, it’s quite true that unless they’ve done
enough work to become sensitive to the subtle levels of Creation, they
won’t necessarily be aware <em>consciously</em> that you are thinking a certain
thought about them. They may only be aware that suddenly <em>they’ve</em> had a
thought of <em>you</em>, and a rather funny feeling is going through their body.
And they’ll pass it off and give it not a second thought. Likewise, if
you think a loving thought, ten thousand miles away someone may suddenly
think of you and feel good in their body and not even know why, and just
let it go by. Why? Because the belief system says that they must be
doing that inside themselves, and it has no connection to you.</p>

<p>In reality, <em>thought</em> is the substance of all things. Thought is an
<em>impulse of pure energy</em>. It is more subtle than anything in the physical
domain. Thought travels far faster than the speed of light. In fact,
light is actually a <em>physical occurrence</em> that emerges long after the
birthing of the dream of separation. So while a light year can seem to
be quite a vast thing in your world of physics, rest assured that
<em>thought travels instantaneously</em>. In fact, <em>thought is immediately present
everywhere</em>. As you are a conscious mind, a body-mind, abiding in the
Ocean of Pure Mind, you literally receive the impressions of all thought
being thought anywhere. It comes into your auric field. And your auric
field is really nothing more than the trough that seems to separate one
wave from another — but in fact, the trough of those waves <em>joins</em> them
one to another.</p>

<p>All fields of thought, then, in a sense, wash up to the shoreline of
your being. <em>You</em> elect what influences will enter into your sphere. Some
of those will pass through, and some you will begin to become identified
with. You’ll take them on as <em>your</em> thought. You’ll form an <em>agreement</em> with
the nature of that thought. You will value that thought, and therefore
create experiences that <em>flow</em> from your agreement, your valuation.</p>

<p>For virtually all beings born within the human sphere, one such
agreement is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am just the body, and therefore I am separate from all others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is merely an agreement, <em>a decision to create experience</em>. You are
equally free to say within yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am more than a body. My mind is vast and unlimited. And that is the
deeper essence of my identity and my existence. I am in perfect
communication with all forms of life at all times. I need only withdraw
my attention from my perception of my body to access communication with
anyone at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Track t2 -->

<p>I said once in <em>A Course in Miracles</em> that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have never forgotten the body, even for a moment. And yet, a moment is
all it takes to realize that you are not the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not mean by this that you should <em>deny</em> the body, but rather, that
you be willing to <em>surrender</em> your <em>perception of what the body is</em>, that it
is not a device that separates you at all. And why is this so? You see,
you once decided to dream the impossible dream: the dream of separation.
The body is the result of that thought — the <em>attempt</em> to <em>create something</em>
that succeeds in separating you from the Mind of God. But you have never
succeeded. For in the moment that that began to emerge, the Holy Spirit
already translated it into something that is not a <em>separation</em> device,
but a <em>communication</em> device. You failed. The Holy Spirit did not!</p>

<p>This means that the body, itself, is <em>constantly</em> receiving input in the
form of subtle energy vibration from <em>everything</em> and <em>everyone</em> around it.
You are like a giant radio station that is picking up and transmitting
signals constantly. If you would like proof of this, and especially if
you would like proof of how powerful thought is as it expresses
vibration through the body, simply create what you call in your world, I
believe, the <em>dowsing rods</em>. Take two pieces of metal. It could be two
parts of a coat hanger. Bend them so that you can gently hold one end,
and hold them in your hands about six inches from your body. And then
have a friend stand about twenty feet away and have them think thoughts
of negativity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am unworthy. I am not worthy of being loved. I have no energy. I’m not worth anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as they’re doing that, walk toward them and see how close you get
before your dowsing rods of metal begin to move around. Then, back up
and find just the <em>edge</em> where their energy field is influencing the rods.</p>

<p>Then go back again, twenty or thirty feet, and have them change their
mind. Have them begin to think <em>loving</em> thoughts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am One with God. Love flows through me perfectly. I am so glad to be
alive!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They need not say it out loud. They need not move a muscle. They need
only think differently. Then again walk toward them, and see when you
find the point where the rods in your hands begin to move about. You’ll
find that their energy field is <em>much larger</em> with the positive thought
than with the negative.</p>

<p>Now, your body is like a divining rod. And so is everyone else’s.
Therefore, those with confidence, those who love themselves, those who
are not concerned with the good opinions of the world, who just go
forward in the direction of what they love, are the ones that seem to
gain the greatest support in the Universe. Why? Because when such a one
walks into a bank to get a business loan, already knowing that this is a
great idea and they’re going to bring the fullness of their being to it,
and they couldn’t possibly fail, just walking in the door, they are
bringing an energy field that influences and touches the loan officer.</p>

<p>Those that walk in going:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>God, I wish I could get this business loan, but I just don’t know. I
don’t have any experience in this. They’re going to look at me like I’m
a schmuck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That person walks in with a much condensed energy field; it’s very weak.
The quality of vibration of the thought is emanating out and touching
the energy field of the loan officer. If you were the loan officer, who
would you rather do business with?</p>

<p>Therefore, <em>Love</em> … when <em>Love</em> leads the way, when <em>Love</em> is the Field of
Energy that you are abiding within, everywhere you go, you are touching
the Universe in a way much more subtle than the conscious mind. And that
Universe will <em>respond</em> to you, because Love responds to Itself like a
flower that opens to sunlight.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not telling you anything you don’t already know. But you
haven’t stopped to consider how <em>profoundly important</em> it is in the nature
of your own life. You know that <em>you</em> respond to a happy person, to a kind
person, to a loving person more than you would to a person who’s being
wicked. It’s simple common sense. You know that you love to be around
beings that talk about unlimitedness, that talk about great vision. Why?
Because they’re reminding you that you, too, are a great visionary, that
unlimitedness is the natural state of the Kingdom of Heaven. The problem
is that you’ve unwittingly taught yourself to live from fear, to think
negative thoughts, to believe that the opinions of the world mean
something. You have literally created a world in which people are
negatively-minded, don’t want to support you, don’t think you’re worth
anything. And yet, <em>you</em> are the one that’s projecting that belief about
<em>yourself</em>, and you, therefore, will attract a like vibration. For like
attracts like.</p>

<p>If you, therefore, want to attract beings who will support you and love
you, decide to be a being who supports and loves <em>yourself</em>. Decide to
open your arms wide, as we spoke of in last month’s tape, to receive the
Love, the presence, the pleasure of God’s Presence. Think only loving
thoughts. Learn to master forgiveness. Dare to follow your heart!
Celebrate life! Do what brings you joy! Walk as one confident in the
Light of Christ! Dare to look out upon the world and say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My Father has set the table before me, and every being and blade of
grass is here to support my enjoyment of God!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as you cultivate that kind of discipline, <em>your life will change</em> — as
it <em>must</em>. For the Universe responds to the vibrational quality that you
are emitting from the radio station of your own mind.</p>

<!-- Track t3 -->

<p>Beloved friends, you are, indeed, Love. But when you decide — as you get
up in your day — that you must fear the attitude of the boss, that you
must safeguard the feelings of the spouse, that you must sacrifice in
order to be conformed to the opinions of the world, you shrink your
energy field. And the only thing that leaks out is something like the
statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I choose to live in fear. I’m not willing to be bold and big and happy.
I don’t want to laugh too much today because somebody might be offended.
I won’t tell you my truth because it might disrupt your energy field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of that is delusion. You are free. You are here to celebrate. You
are here to be outrageous. You are here to extend Love, and Love cannot
be extended through a contracted energy field. Therefore, teach yourself
to notice each fearful thought. Teach yourself to notice when your
energy field is contracted and do the opposite: <em>choose to receive Love</em>!
And if you start to go through a single day, and you notice that by five
o’clock your energy field isn’t feeling very good, ask yourself where
have you been waiting for Love to show up as a gift of something or
someone else to you. Stop what you’re doing and be the one who gives
Love to <em>yourself</em> — simply so that you can enjoy it.</p>

<p><em>The essence of this hour’s sharing is this: You, and you alone, are
completely responsible for the quality of your experience of each
moment.</em> No one is doing anything to you. The world is not an unsafe
place. And what you experience in life is the direct result of what
flows from the inside <em>out</em>. For there can be no flow from the outside <em>in</em>,
except that which you <em>receive</em> and make <em>your own</em>. Is there any point,
then, to be fearful of something? Of course not! If you <em>are</em> fearful, at
least accept that you have <em>decreed</em> it to be so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I choose to be fearful of being a millionaire, and therefore I will not
take this opportunity and run with it.</p>

  <p>I am fearful of the opinions of others, therefore I will not give
speeches in public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I choose to have the experience of being a contracted and fearful human being.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least take ownership and recognize the simple Truth that as the world
shows up to reflect that fear to you, it is doing so only out of <em>loving
service to you</em>.</p>

<p>You see, the Universe is only Love. And beings will respond to you
according to what you want to call into your being, that’s all. Nothing
else is even possible. It is quite true that you may be calling a
calamity to yourself because you, as a soul, are ready to discover a
greater depth of Love and forgiveness in yourself. Life might bring you
challenges, but only because you’ve <em>asked</em> it to bring you challenges so
that you can grow your capacity to maturely direct Love in this world.
Nothing can occur that you have not called to yourself.</p>

<p>I could not begin to tell you how many times I have conspired to create
opportunities for many, many beings to step into the fullness of their
Christed Consciousness with full power and glory in the shortest
possible time, only to have them say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, no. I can’t do that. That’s just not who I am. I have to go do
something else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the something else is always something based on <em>fear</em>, something the
egoic part of the mind thinks that they can be comfortable with, and
something that will take them <em>many more lifetimes</em> to reach the same
result.</p>

<p><em>The Holy Spirit always knows the shortest route to God.</em> It <em>will</em>, when
presented to you, bring up for you your deepest fears, since it is <em>fear</em>
that obstructs the Light of Truth. How, then, do you dissolve the power
of fear? By recognizing it, by feeling it, and by owning the simple fact
that fear is not your master and continuing to walk on. The “ring of
fear” of which I speak quite deeply in <em>A Course in Miracles</em>, is simply
that. The ring of fear is something constructed from the inside out. In
Reality, all power under Heaven and Earth is given unto the Holy Son of
God. And when you are presented with an opportunity, you are not
presented something in which you are asked to walk alone. And if you
accept the Holy Spirit’s function as your own, <em>every obstacle is removed
before you reach it</em>.</p>

<!-- Track t4 -->

<p>Many would look at this, my beloved brother, and say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gee, you must really be abiding in Christ Consciousness. Either that, or the
Universe has made you special because, no matter what, things always seem to
work out and miracles lead the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet it is not specialness at all. It is merely his recognition that
the Holy Spirit’s function is the only <em>right-minded</em> function. And that
function can look any way it wants to look. He has learned that his
delight comes from taking in more of God by surrendering into God.</p>

<p>Shanti Christo is a pebble dropped into the pond of his mind, and into
the mind of his friend and, shall we say, cosmic mate, simply because
the place was prepared through the cultivation of trust and the decision
to follow only that pathway set forth by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Therefore indeed, beloved friends, where in your life are <em>you</em> resisting
the opportunities that have been presented to you? Where have you
resisted and said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, that’s just not me. I’m not that way. I really can’t do that,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>when, in fact, you’re merely afraid of the world? Fear has defeated you.
And in <em>The Way of Knowing</em>, fear has no power. One simply abides and
does, gives it back to God, and goes on.</p>

<p>In the day when your body-mind returns to the dust of the ground, which
is an old way of saying that the energy that is holding the subtle forms
of matter (what you call your molecules and atoms) together to create an
appearance of something solid . . . When that energy is gone, called the
intention and will, the mind is shifted somewhere else and the body
dissolves, you will remain as you’ve always been: pure intelligence,
pure potentiality, pure perception. You will still be creating, and you
will merely generate energy fields that will create experiences in
worlds around you.</p>

<p>You abide, then — <em>now</em> — in the perfect opportunity to <em>walk through</em> your
rings of fear. Therefore, look well. Where do you feel a contraction, a
fear, a hesitancy? Is it in something that needs to be said to a friend?
The more <em>transparent</em> you become, the more you merely speak when you feel
moved to speak, do when you feel moved to do, go where you feel moved to
go, laugh as you feel moved to laugh, and cry as you feel moved to cry,
the less resistance you have to the flow and movement of life emanating
from your own heart and soul — recognizing your perfect innocence and
the perfection of all things. The more you do that, the more you will
create for yourself a mindset, a state of being, so that when the body
dissolves and you are in your infinite magnificence, fear will not
contract you. You will simply say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh! Well! What can I create now? I seem not to have a physical body any more. Hmm… How interesting!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where you choose to <em>resist</em> moving through your rings of fear, <em>as you
know they exist in your current life</em>, you are building a prison for
God’s Son — pure and simple. The world will tell you,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not trust the impulse of the heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not the impulse of the ego or the mind, but the impulse of the <em>heart</em>.
And yet, it is in the <em>heart</em> that the guidance of the Holy Spirit speaks.</p>

<!-- Track t5 -->

<p>Indeed, beloved friends, in <em>The Way of Knowing</em>, there is a <em>certainty of
Knowing</em> that it is the places in which fear seems to be cropping up that
is the actual <em>doorway</em> to greater God Consciousness. If there is
something that you feel fearful of sharing with another, <em>there</em> is your
doorway. Go and share your truth, for no other reason — not to persuade,
not to be right — but just to do the sharing so that you get through the
ring of fear. That’s all. If you feel your heart constantly calling you
to live as a penniless mendicant on the streets of London, and it’s been
calling to you for thirty years, go and sell all that you have and
<em>follow your heart</em>.</p>

<p>Now, I know that the world has not taught you to live in such a way. But
the world is the opposite of the Truth of the Kingdom. Love all. Become
the one that serves all, by loving first yourself. Learn to quiet the
roar and the din of the world, which is nothing more than your decision
to place a <em>value</em> on how the rest of the world is thinking. Serve only
that Voice of Truth within yourself. And that Voice of Truth within
yourself is the Voice that says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boy, go start a garden today! Oh, yes! I don’t know how to garden. How
am I going to figure this one out? But I really want to start a garden.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go start a garden!</p>

<p>Some would say this is living from your <em>authenticity</em>. I do not speak of
what is authentic as being what the <em>mind</em> thinks, that is, its social
image. That is not authentic at all. That’s a mask, a persona. What is
authentic is what you feel in the core and the depth of your being — <em>in
innocence</em>. And what do I mean by that? The <em>innocent heart</em> is not needy.
It doesn’t require selected individuals to agree with it. It doesn’t
wait until the Universe nods its head in approval. It merely <em>knows</em> it is
innocent and acts from it, and is not attached to the opinions of the
world. <em>Authenticity</em> is the core through which Christ Mind grows. And any
time you look and see that you’ve not been living authentically, and
decide to take a deep breath and let your illusions be shattered by
becoming transparent and telling the truth, and allowing whatever
changes that need to occur to occur — then indeed, you are growing your
Christ Mind.</p>

<p>In <em>The Way of Knowing</em>, then, you are asked constantly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where am I being inauthentic?</p>

  <p>Where am I just showing up the way I think Harry down the street needs
me to show up?</p>

  <p>Where am I being a vegetarian so that I can feel superior to those that
are not?</p>

  <p>Where am I controlling my diet because I am afraid that this substance
will make me less spiritual?</p>

  <p>Where am I denying my humanity in order to present an image to another?</p>

  <p>Where am I getting up and going to the same job every day, when I know
in the secret of my own depth of my beingness, that I just don’t want to
be there any more?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To live authentically, in some sense, is to live alone. To live alone
simply means that you no longer are run by needing to look a certain
way, succeed in a certain way, so that the judgment of the world will
nod its head and give you a “10” instead of a “1.”</p>

<p>In <em>The Way of Knowing</em>, the mind comes to grasp the simple metaphysical
Truth that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I, and I alone, am creating my tomorrows. And if I create inauthenticity now,
I can rest assured, I will experience it tomorrow. If I create imprisonment for
my soul now, I will experience it tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And because Creation is <em>eternal</em>, it is impossible not to have a tomorrow
— whether in this world or another.</p>

<!-- Track t6 -->

<p>Beloved friends, you were created to create. You were created out of an
overflow of Joy and Love. Therefore, live joyously, live lovingly of
<em>yourself</em>. Dare to consider that your Self is <em>so important</em> that you have
an obligation never to settle for less than your own authenticity.
Sometimes that requires beginning the process of discovering what is
authentically yours and not merely the influence of others.</p>

<p>Where, beloved friends, are you still being inauthentic? Where are you
responding with a smile when you’re actually feeling anger? Where are
you responding with an “OK,” when inwardly the answer is, “No”? Where
are you responding in fear to a substance you would put in your body?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t eat that because that’s a very bad substance, and I want to be
healthy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the very fear that is creating a tomorrow of unhealthiness.</p>

<p>Love heals all things. Love transmutes all things. Love embraces all
things, and thereby, transcends all things. Where are you not allowing
Love to be your Reality?</p>

<p>And so, beloved friends, already in this very short hour, we have spoken
to a certain theme, yet again. We ask you to consider it well. Do not be
in a hurry to merely put this tape aside. Listen to it a few times. And
wherever you suddenly hear a question instead of a statement, pause the
tape and spend some time considering it — quietly, as though you were
allowing the answer to emerge from your <em>innocence</em>. And then ask
yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What changes can I make so that I’m truly showing up in a more authentic way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And with that, we’re going to let that be enough for now.</p>

<p>For those of you that truly choose to, you’ll find that if you abide
with the message of this hour, engage the simple quiet questions that
are asked, and contemplate certain key thoughts that were, in a sense,
repeated, much movement can occur, much liberation can occur.</p>

<p>You are Christ. And you are free in the world of space and time <em>to know
it as deeply as possible</em>.</p>

<p>And with that, peace be unto you always.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<h2 id="question-one">Question One</h2>

<p class="omit"><a href="/questions/k04q1/"><em>Question One</em></a>: Jeshua, in <em>A Course in
Miracles</em> you say something about the “Great Rays of Light.” What is
that about?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-two">Question Two</h2>

<p class="omit"><a href="/questions/k04q2/"><em>Question Two</em></a>: You say that everyone is
Christ, yet even among highly enlightened beings, there seems to be some
difference. Does everyone have their own <em>unique soul essence</em>?</p>
