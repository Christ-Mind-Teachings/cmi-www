    <p>39.1 My beloved,</p>

<p>39.2 It is time now to come to your own discovery of who I Am to you. No
one can give you this answer, not even me, because this is the nature of
who we are. Individuated beings are who we are in relationship to one
another.</p>

<p>39.3 You have heard of life spoken of as a projection. Because we are
all one being, we must either extend or project in order to individuate
and be in relationship. You are an extension of I Am into form. Through
your extension, you can become who you are to me, instead of who I have
been to you.</p>

<p>39.4 You may find it difficult to give yourself an answer to who I Am to
you in words, and even if you are able to do so, you may not be able to
share this answer in a way that makes sense to anyone else. Let this
tell you something.</p>

<p>39.5 We are going to speak again of contradiction here. Of the
importance of your knowing who I Am to you, and of the importance of
being able to continually discover who I Am to you. Of your embrace of
knowing, and your embrace of mystery. Of knowing me as your God and as
God of all. Of knowing you are no longer being on your own and yet of
having to come to this realization of who I Am to you on your own.</p>

<p>39.6 This is the beginning of individuation in union and relationship.
This is the beginning of wholeness. What you strive for here is
revelation. For only through revelation can you know all and still hold
the mystery. This revelation is not something being withheld from you.
But it is a revelation that can only come to you as an individuated
being in union and relationship. This is what makes it a true
revelation. Because true revelation is between you and me.</p>

<p>39.7 “Between” you and me is the presence of Christ. Remember we have
talked about the Christ “in” you. Remember that you have been told of
Christ being a bridge. When you relate to anyone, Christ is there,
bridging the distance that would keep you separate and holding you in
relationship. Christ has provided the necessary link between the
separate and each other, between all and God. Yet if the time of Christ
is about the end of the need for the intermediary, what becomes of the
intermediary relationship Christ seems to offer? Are you ready to hold
relationship on your own?</p>

<p>39.8 Contemplate the “buffer” nature of all that is intermediary. An
intermediary stands between as well as links. It is a totally
unnecessary requirement in unity because the boundaries of separation
have fallen. To be individuated being in union and relationship is to be
Christ, to realize that what we call Christ is the integration of
relationship into the Self.</p>

<p>39.9 Being in union is being all. Being in union and relationship
requires individuation, and individuation requires relationship. Thus
you must now accept yourself as Christ, or as the bridge of relationship
between all that is individuated in union and relationship.</p>

<p>39.10 This is why you must discover your own relationship with me.
Discovering your own relationship with me is discovering the Christ in
you. When you have discovered your own relationship with me is when you
have discovered that you are who I Am because you realize—or make
real—your oneness with Christ. When you have discovered your own
relationship with me is when an intermediary is no longer needed—because
you have realized and made real your oneness with Christ. When
relationship is established you realize that relationship is the
intermediary link between individuated beings and that you hold this
link, through relationship with me, within yourself.  Christ is direct
relationship with me.</p>

<p>39.11 Establishing this relationship with me may sound lofty and
difficult, but it is simple. It is as simple as relationship is within
your everyday life. You may not think that relationship within everyday
life is simple, but you also know it as a constant. You know that you
have had “good” relationships and “bad” relationships, love
relationships and work relationships, and that being in relationship
with “others” is an inescapable truism of your life. Even these
relationships of separation, the types of special and not-so-special
relationships you have chosen to leave behind, are not done away with
but only transformed. Relationship is part of life. Inescapable.
Acceptance that our relationship is and that it is a determinant of who
we both are, is all that is required. The relationship that you accept
with me is the relationship of union, for union is no more than this, as
we are one in being and when you have discovered relationship, we are
one in union as well.</p>

<p>39.12 Relationship itself is intermediary, it is what you carry, the
connection between one thing and another. In this instance it is the
connection between two individuated beings in union and relationship.
You and me. In order for this link of relationship to exist there must
be two beings for it to link (where two or more are joined together). In
other words, there must be a you and a me. In other words, as you are
individuated, so too am I. We jointly individuate rather than separate.
We can only do this in relationship. We can only have relationship as
individuated beings.</p>

<p>39.13 Thus, both must occur as one.</p>

<p>39.14 This is like the big bang, the explosion of creation. It is all at
once. All of Everything. Yet in relationship.</p>

<p>39.15 What must occur now must occur between you and me. Your
willingness is all that is required.</p>

<p>39.16 Let me tell you what has occurred in the past so that you know not
to respond to love in the same way again.</p>

<p>39.17 Who I have been to you is who you have been to yourself. Remember
the idea of projection. This is what projection does. It projects
outward. It is different from extension in that extension is like a
projection that remains at one with its source. Projection separates.</p>

<p>39.18 You have separated me from you through your projection. And yet
what you projected and called God, just as what you projected and named
thousands of other “things,” you separated from yourself only in time
and space. In time and space your projections became separate and other
than you. This is what the world of time and space is. A world that is a
projection that you have made, a world that has the shape and form, the
character and value, the image and meaning, that you would give it. This
is your universe. I have been, to you, the God of this universe.</p>

<p>39.19 Thus your ideas of the universe and your ideas of me have been
inseparable projections. As have your ideas of the universe and your
ideas of your own self.</p>

<p>39.20 Have I been a benevolent God in your universe? Then you have been
benevolent and seen your universe as a benevolent universe.</p>

<p>39.21 Have I been a judgmental God in your universe? Then you have been
judgmental and lived in a judgmental world.</p>

<p>39.22 Have I been a powerful God who can work miracles? Then you have
been a powerful miracle worker.</p>

<p>39.23 Have I been a distant God who does not show his love for you or
others? Then you have been distant from yourself and those you love.</p>

<p>39.24 Have I been a God you have sought and never found? Then you have
not found yourself.</p>

<p>39.25 Have I been a fair God? Then you have been fair and the world has
treated you fairly.</p>

<p>39.26 Have I been the God of your religion? Then you have been
religious.</p>

<p>39.27 Have I been a God of vengeance? Then you have been vengeful.</p>

<p>39.28 Have I been a God of love? Then you have been loving.</p>

<p>39.29 Have I been all of these? So, too, then, have you, and so too has
your universe been.</p>

<p>39.30 Has your God not been a god at all, but science, money, career,
beauty, fame, celebrity, intellect? Then these things have become the
content of who you are. Science, money, fame, celebrity, intellect or
any other concept that has become your God can be a tough task master,
or a fair friend, loving or unloving, distance you from yourself and
others or bring you closer to yourself and others. No god who has been
projected is without attributes, even gods such as these.</p>

<p>39.31 Have you had no god, no science, no beauty, no wealth, but only a
meager and hopeless life? Then your god has been the god of defeat.</p>

<p>39.32 Have you had no god, no science, no career, no fame, but only a
life of hate and violence? Then your god has been the god of bitterness.</p>

<p>39.33 Everyone has a god because everyone has a being and an identity
for that being. Everyone carries the memory of I Am.</p>

<p>39.34 What memory of I Am will you carry with you now that you know that
I Am is who I am and who you are? What memory has this Course and this
Dialogue returned to you? What memory is without attributes because it
is who I Am and not a projection? Only love. What memory is not a
memory, but your identity? Only love.</p>

<p>39.35 Only that which is by nature without attributes can be one in
being in union and relationship and individuate. Could you become your
sister or your brother? A tree become a frog? The sun the moon? Yet love
could become all of these, because love, by its nature, has no
attributes. Love is creation’s genesis, the unattributable given the
attributes of form.</p>

<p>39.36 Who Am I to you? Only who you are to yourself. Now it is time for
you to be not who you have been to yourself, but who you are, and have
been, to me.</p>

<p>39.37 Here is where we must return to paradox, to knowing who you are
and who I Am and to constantly discovering who you are and who I Am,
because who you are and who I Am are the same being in the constant
creative tension of differentiating from one another.</p>

<p>39.38 This is a time of knowing who you are and who I Am while at the
same time, holding, or carrying, the mystery within you. That mystery is
the tension of opposites. It is time and eternity. Love and hate. Good
and evil. In other words, All and Nothing. It is the tension of
individuation, a tension that has existed since the beginning of time,
between time and eternity, between the attributeless love and the
attribute laden being. Between the one being of love and the many beings
of form, between love’s extension and form’s projection.</p>

<p>39.39 This is a time of knowing you are not on your own but that you
must come into direct relationship with me on your own and of your own
free will.</p>

<p>39.40 All of these aspects of what stand between are also an aspect of
the Christ in you.</p>

<p>39.41 But breathe a sigh of relief, my beloved, for you do not have to
learn all that the Christ in you learned. This is why we have had to
enter the time of non-learning—so that you accept that you do not have
to try to learn the unlearnable. This is why we have left the time of
becoming behind, why you stand ready to enter the time of being in union
and relationship. The Christ in you is the accomplished. The Christ in
you is that which, upon this final acceptance, returns your wholeness to
you.</p>

<p>39.42 Realize your own expansion, the expansion that has taken place
under the tutelage of Jesus, within the dialogue with
Christ-consciousness, within the recesses of your heart where your
relationship with love has never been severed. Realize your readiness.
Proclaim your willingness.</p>

<p>39.43 Realize that I love your smile, your teeth, the hair upon your
head, the warm, smooth shape of your skull. Realize that I love your
hands and that as you take another’s hand, you hold my own, and that I
am with you as well as within you. Realize that I love all that you are,
and that as you snarl in anger, cry in despair, hang your head in
weariness, howl with laughter, I am with you and within you.</p>

<p>39.44 You will realize as you enter union by means of the bridge of our
direct relationship that you will not leave your humanity behind. You
will realize that as you enter union by means of the bridge of our
direct relationship that you will no longer see me as an inhuman God.
You will know I am as human as are you and that you are as godly as am
I.</p>

<p>39.45 Do not expect perfection, only union. Do not expect sainthood,
only Godhood. Do not expect the world, expect heaven. Do not expect
answers, only knowing. Do not expect learning, only revelation. Do not
expect all, without also expecting nothing. Expect to know that you hold
both within yourself and that you hold me as I hold you.</p>

<p>39.46 You will realize as you enter union that the tension of opposites
is the individuation process and that you are the bridge. You are the
bridge to me. I am the bridge to you. You are the bridge to your
brothers and sisters. They are your bridge to yourself. You will also be
the bridge between war and peace, sadness and joy, evil and good,
sickness and health. You will turn anger to gladness, tears to laughter,
and replace weariness with rest. But you will still know all of these.
You will know the All of Everything and the emptiness of nothing and our
relationship will bridge the distance and become cause and effect, means
and end.</p>

<p>39.47 You will realize that as we individuate we are in a constant state
of creation as well as of creative tension. As we become individuated
beings in union and relationship, we continuously create one another. We
create from the field of the possible which must include everything.</p>

<p>39.48 Do you not realize yet, that this is what we do and who we are?
That we are creators? That we think, feel, know, and create. Creation is
the manifestation of all we think, feel, know and come to know. Because
we are constantly creating, we are constantly coming to know anew. This
is eternity. A being in time wants to be known in time but can only be
known in eternity. You now are the bridge between time and eternity.</p>

<p>39.49 And so am I. As the Christ in you ceases to be a bridge, the
Christ in you is not only integrated into you but integrated into me. I
could no more reach across time and space without this relationship than
could you. Only with our willingness joined, are we able to negate the
need for intermediaries and be in relationship. Only with our
willingness joined do we both become, welcome, and share, the Christ
relationship to and with each other.</p>

<p>39.50 This is who I know you to be and who you, in union with me, know
me to be.</p>
