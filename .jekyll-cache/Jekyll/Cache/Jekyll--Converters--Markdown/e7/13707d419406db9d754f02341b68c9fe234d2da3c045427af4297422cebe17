<div class="ui container">

<p>Sharing bookmarks and quotes using the email list allows you to personalize messages
when sending to groups. See the <a href="/acq/bookmark/">Bookmark documentation</a> for more
information.</p>

<h2 id="manage-topics-and-create-quotes">Manage Topics and Create Quotes</h2>

<p>Manage Topics allows you to edit or delete topics and display bookmarks by
topic. This is a powerful way to group bookmarks by topic and consider the
message of Christ Mind from a given perspective. The topics, of course, are
defined by the user, and bookmarks too, so it takes some consideration to
create good bookmarks.</p>

<p>This feature also allows you to define certain bookmarks as quotes that will be
displayed as quotes on a teaching home page.</p>

<h3 id="page-description">Page Description</h3>

<p>There is a table for each source in the Library.</p>

<div class="ui container">
  <img class="massive ui image" src="/public/img/cmi/mt-main.jpg" />
</div>

<p>You can manage bookmarks from all sources. Start by clicking the ‘Fetch’ button 
for the source(s) of interest. This will fetch all bookmarks and topics for 
the source.</p>

<p>After the ‘Fetch’ is complete the number of topics and bookmarks is displayed.</p>

<div class="ui container">
  <img class="massive ui image" src="/public/img/cmi/mt-fetch.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Next click the ‘Focus’ button to operate on bookmarks and topics for the associated
source.</p>

<div class="ui container">
  <img class="massive ui image" src="/public/img/cmi/mt-action-manager.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Focus hides all other sources and allows you to edit or delete topics and to display
bookmarks by one or more topics.</p>

<p>To return to the list of sources just press the ‘Show All’ button.</p>

<p>To display bookmarks, select one or more topics from the dropdown list and press the 
‘Display Annotations’ button. If you have selected more than one topic use the OR/AND
toggle to indicate how you want topics to be treated.</p>

<p>When OR is selected (this is the default), a bookmark is displayed if it contains any one
of the selected topics. When AND is selected, a bookmark is dispalyed if it contains
each of the select topics.</p>

<p>You can limit bookmarks displayed to the one selected in the ‘Books’ dropdown. By default
bookmarks for all books are displayed.</p>

<h3 id="topic-management">Topic Management</h3>

<p>When you click the ‘Manage Topics’ button a list of topics is displayed. Use the 
<i class="pencil icon"></i> icon to edit the name of the topic and the <i class="trash alternate icon"></i>
icon to delete the topic.</p>

<div class="ui container">
  <img class="massive ui image" src="/public/img/cmi/mt-topic-manager.jpg" />
</div>

<p>When you delete a topic it will also be deleted from all bookmarks that reference it. You will
be asked to confirm your decision to delete a topic before it is deleted.</p>

<p>If you change a topic name or delete a topic you must press the ‘Apply Changes’ button to make
the changes permanent. If you attempt to leave the page with changes pending you will be warned
that leaving the page may cause you to lose data.</p>

<p>The Topic editor can be closed by pressing the ‘Un-Manage Topics’ button.</p>

<h3 id="display-annotations">Display Annotations</h3>

<p>This features allows you to query bookmarks by one or more topics. Select topic(s) from the 
dropdown menu and click the “Display Annotations” button.</p>

<div class="ui container">
  <img class="massive ui image" src="/public/img/cmi/mt-query.jpg" />
</div>

<p>In this example there are 867 bookmarks for The Way of Mastery and we have asked to 
see those that contain either “Description” or “Love” topics. The query header shows
that 100 bookmarks were found.</p>

<p>We could search for bookmarks containing both “Description” and “Love” topics by clicking
the toggle to the right of the topic dropdown to change the condition to AND. Click
“Display Annotations” again after you do this.</p>

<p>From the list of bookmarks displayed you can click the Book Title in the bookmark header to 
do directly to the bookmark in the source. This is handy if you want to make changes such
as adding or removing topics.</p>

<p>You can also filter the results by bookmark type. The filter is disabled by default. Clicking
“Note” will display only Note style bookmarks and “Selected” will display only 
Selected Text style bookmarks. This is useful when creating Quotes, described below.</p>

<div class="ui container">
  <img class="massive ui image" src="/public/img/cmi/mt-query-results.jpg" />
</div>

<p>The image above shows only Selected Text bookmarks with the bookmark header hidden.
Hiding the header makes it easy to copy bookmark text to another application. The number
at the bottom of the bookmark indicates it’s origin and can be used as a citation.</p>

<p>When the number is shown in red, that indicates that the bookmark is a quote. All quotes
are hidden when the “Hide Quotes” button is clicked making it easier to continue defining
quotes.</p>

<h3 id="defining-quotes">Defining Quotes</h3>

<p>Quotes are displayed on the home page of a source and can be shared to Facebook and by email.
Quotes are defined from Selected Text bookmarks and not from Note Style bookmarks. There are
CMI defined quotes available for several sources and more will be added and you can
create your own quotes as well.</p>

<p>Here’s how to create your own quotes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Define one or more bookmarks by selecting text from a transcript. Associate a topic with the
bookmark to make it easy to find. ‘Quote’ is a good topic to use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the Manage Topics page and query bookmarks by the topic “Quote” or whatever topic
you have used.</p>

    <div class="ui container">
  <img class="massive ui image" src="/public/img/cmi/mt-quotes.jpg" />
</div>

    <p>Here, bookmarks are filter by Selected Text so only bookmarks that from which
quotes can be defined are displayed. And 54 existing quotes have been hidden from
display as can be seen from the “Show Quotes” button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To define a quote, click the “citation” link to display the quote editor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can edit the quote if needed so that it reads better as a quote. Just change the
text as needed. Click “Add Quote” to save. The quote citation will display as red after
the quote has been saved.</p>

    <div class="ui container">
  <img class="massive ui image" src="/public/img/cmi/mt-quote-editor.jpg" />
</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can edit the quote by clicking on the red citation link.</p>

    <div class="ui container">
  <img class="massive ui image" src="/public/img/cmi/mt-edited-quote.jpg" />
</div>

    <p>In this example the quote has been edited to remove “, then,” from the original
text. The quote text from the database is shown in the second text box. This is
not editable.</p>

    <p>The original text from the transcript is shown in the first text box. You can change
this text if desired or press the “Update Quote” button without editing to restore
the original text of the quote.</p>

    <p>You can also delete the quote entirely by pressing “Delete”.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When you have created your own quotes, they will be available along with existing
CMI defined quotes as shown below.</p>

<div class="ui container">
  <img class="massive ui image" src="/public/img/cmi/quote-select.jpg" />
</div>
