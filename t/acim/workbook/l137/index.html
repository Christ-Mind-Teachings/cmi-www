    <p class="omit"><a class="hide-review" href="/workbook/l149/#l137">Review</a></p>

<p>Today’s idea remains the central thought on which salvation rests. For
healing is the opposite of all the world’s ideas which dwell on sickness
and on separate states. Sickness is a retreat from others, and a
shutting off of joining. It becomes a door that closes on a separate
self, and keeps it isolated and alone.</p>

<p>Sickness is isolation. For it seems to keep one self apart from all the
rest, to suffer what the others do not feel. It gives the body final
power to make the separation real and keep the mind in solitary prison,
split apart and held in pieces by a solid wall of sickened flesh which
it can not surmount. The world obeys the laws that sickness serves, but
healing operates apart from them.</p>

<p>It is impossible that anyone be healed alone. In sickness must he be
apart and separate. But healing is his own decision to be one again, and
to accept his Self with all Its parts intact and unassailed. In sickness
does his Self appear to be dismembered and without the unity that gives
It life. But healing is accomplished as he sees the body has no power to
attack the universal Oneness of God’s Son.</p>

<p>Sickness would prove that lies must be the truth. But healing
demonstrates that truth is true. The separation sickness would impose has
never really happened. To be healed is merely to accept what always was
the simple truth, and always will remain exactly as it has forever been.
Yet eyes accustomed to illusions must be shown that what they look upon
is false. So healing, never needed by the truth, must demonstrate that
sickness is not real.</p>

<p>Healing might thus be called a counter-dream which cancels out the dream
of sickness in the name of truth, but not in truth itself. Just as
forgiveness overlooks all sins that never were accomplished, healing but
removes illusions that have not occurred. Just as the real world will
arise to take the place of what has never been at all, healing offers
restitution for imagined states and false ideas which dreams embroider
into pictures of the truth.</p>

<p>Yet think not healing is unworthy of your function here. For anti-Christ
becomes more powerful than Christ to those who dream
the world is real. The body seems to be more solid and more stable than
the mind. And love becomes a dream, while fear remains the one reality
that can be seen and justified and fully understood.</p>

<p>Just as forgiveness shines away all sin, and the real world will occupy
the place of what you made, so healing must replace the fantasies of
sickness which you hold before the simple truth. When sickness has been
seen to disappear inspite of all the laws that hold it cannot but be
real, then questions have been answered. And the laws can be no longer
cherished nor obeyed.</p>

<p>Healing is freedom. For it demonstrates that dreams will not prevail
against the truth. Healing is shared. And by this attribute it proves
that laws unlike the ones which hold that sickness is inevitable are
more potent than their sickly opposites. Healing is strength. For by its
gentle hand is weakness overcome. And minds which were walled off within
a body free to join with other minds, to be forever strong.</p>

<p>Healing, forgiveness, and the glad exchange of all the world of sorrow
for a world where sadness cannot enter, are the means by which the Holy
Spirit urges you to follow Him. His gentle lessons teach how easily
salvation can be yours; how little practice you need undertake to let
His laws replace the ones you made to hold yourself a prisoner to death.</p>

<p>His life becomes your own as you extend the little help He asks in
freeing you from everything that ever caused you pain. And as you let
yourself be healed, you see all those around you or who cross your mind
or whom you touch, or those who seem to have no contact with you, healed
along with you. Perhaps you will not recognize them all, nor realize how
great your offering to all the world when you let healing come to you.
But you are never healed alone. And legions upon legions will receive
the gift which you receive when you are healed.</p>

<p>Those who are healed become the instruments of healing. Nor does time
elapse between the instant they are healed and all the grace of healing
it is given them to give. What is opposed to God does not exist. And who
accepts it not within his mind becomes a haven where the weary can
remain to rest. For here is truth bestowed, and here are all illusions
brought to truth.</p>

<p>Would you not offer shelter to God’s Will? You but invite your
Self to be at home, and can this invitation be refused? Ask the
inevitable to occur and you will never fail. The other choice is but to
ask what cannot be to be, and this cannot succeed. Today we ask that only
truth will occupy our minds; that thoughts of healing will this day go
forth from what is healed to what must yet be healed, aware that they
will both occur as one.</p>

<p>We will remember, as the hour strikes, our function is to let our minds
be healed that we may carry healing to the world, exchanging curse for
blessing, pain for joy, and separation for the peace of God. Is not a
minute of the hour worth the giving to receive a gift like this? Is not
a little time a small expense to offer for the gift of everything?</p>

<p>Yet must we be prepared for such a gift. And so we will begin the day
with this, and give ten minutes to these thoughts with which we will
conclude today at night as well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I am healed I am not healed alone.<br />
And I would share my healing with the world,<br />
That sickness may be banished from the mind Of God’s<br />
One Son,Who is my only Self.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let healing be through you this very day. And as you rest in quiet, be
prepared to give as you receive, to hold but what you give, and to
receive the Word of God to take the place of all the foolish thoughts
that ever were imagined. Now we come together to make well all that was
sick, and offer blessing where there was attack. Nor will we let this
function be forgot as every hour of the day slips by, remembering our
function with this thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I am healed I am not healed alone.<br />
And I would bless my brothers, for I would<br />
Be healed with them as they are healed with me.”</p>
</blockquote>
