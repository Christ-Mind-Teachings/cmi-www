        The "P" stands for "Play from Here". When clicked, the "P" turns red, and a <i class="playmark play icon"></i> appears at the head of each paragraph. Clicking any play symbol will cause the audio to begin playing from that point.
        </p>
        <p>
        Note: Doing this can cause a the audio to get out of sync with the highlighting of the current paragraph. I would love to correct this problem but have not yet found a solution.
