It appears an odd word,<br />
yet within it lies the meaning of sacrifice,<br />
of Love,<br />
of true Being.</p>

<p>What, then,<br />
can we say of sacrifice?</p>

<p>The cloak of ignorance<br />
has been cast off,<br />
the darkness of a solitary thought<br />
dissolved in the simple brilliance<br />
of a Light far brighter<br />
than ten thousand suns,<br />
and the soul of one<br />
who has seen through the vanity<br />
of useless wandering<br />
is again restored<br />
to the place from which<br />
it has not ever ventured forth.</p>

<p>The holy one<br />
is again become first,<br />
and sees that nowhere<br />
is there to be found a second.</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>I AM the first-born of my Father,<br />
standing before all things. <br />
Moving not,<br />
I travel far. <br />
Embracing all things, I touch myself.</p>

  <p>Creation arises within me.<br />
I AM the first and the last,<br />
the alpha and omega.</p>

  <p>Fulfilled begond all measure,<br />
I need nothing.<br />
Possessing the whole of Creation,<br />
I desire nothing.</p>

  <p>That which has been,<br />
I AM.<br />
That which is,<br />
I AM.<br />
That which shall be,<br />
I AM.</p>

  <p>Looking far,<br />
I behold not my ancient beginning.<br />
Gazing near,<br />
I see not my end.</p>

  <p>I AM a circle of heavenly Light<br />
embracing all things,<br />
knowing all things,<br />
allowing all things.</p>

  <p>My splendor<br />
fills the vastness of space<br />
and is contained<br />
between two thoughts.</p>

  <p>The wind is birthed<br />
from my holy breath,<br />
and carries my glory<br />
to all far places.</p>

  <p>I AM the power<br />
by which all dreams are dreamt.</p>

  <p>I AM the purpose<br />
of all actions performed.</p>

  <p>I AM the Way,<br />
the Truth, and the Life,<br />
and the whole of Creation<br />
returns to the Father through me.</p>

  <p>I AM the praying,<br />
the prayer,<br />
and the answer.</p>

  <p>I AM the dream,<br />
the dreamer,<br />
and her awakening.</p>

  <p>I AM the sin,<br />
the sinner,<br />
and the salvation.</p>

  <p>I AM the vast ocean<br />
from which<br />
the dew drop arises.</p>

  <p>I AM the tear<br />
on the cheek of a newborn<br />
who brings me into form and time.</p>

  <p>I AM the words<br />
before your eyes,<br />
the writer,<br />
and the one who even now reads.</p>

  <p>I AM the one dreamer<br />
bold enough to imagine<br />
the illusion of separation,<br />
and the one worthy<br />
of releasing the allure of sleep.</p>

  <p>I AM,<br />
simply, that,<br />
I AM.</p>
</div>

<p>It is this<br />
that the awakened Son proclaims,<br />
without a trace of thought<br />
to obscure the brilliance and purity<br />
of his being.</p>

<p>She looks for herself,<br />
and sees only<br />
the Father.</p>

<p>He reaches to himself,<br />
and embraces only<br />
the whole of Creation.</p>

<p>The glass,<br />
once filled with a momentary thought<br />
of imaginary sustenance,<br />
is again<br />
become the emptiness<br />
overflowing with living waters.</p>

<p>The holy chalice<br />
is raised to her lips.<br />
She drinks eternally,<br />
and is satisfied.</p>

<p>Herein<br />
is the meaning of sacrifice:<br />
Never has there existed<br />
what must be eternally unreal,<br />
and what is <em>not</em><br />
can be neither lost<br />
nor sacrificed.</p>

<p>What, then,<br />
would you cling<br />
so tightly unto?</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>Servantship<br />
is that which arises<br />
when the death<br />
of what could never possibly be<br />
is irrevocably allowed.</p>

<p>It is the perfect heritage<br />
extended from the Father<br />
to the Son,<br />
and is of one substance<br />
with the Mystery<br />
that our Heavenly Father is.</p>

<p>Servantship<br />
requires only<br />
the <em>enactment</em> of sacrifice,<br />
that sacrifice which is,<br />
from the beginning,<br />
already completed:<br />
the Grace of God.</p>

<p>Our choice to remember<br />
who we are<br />
is the enactment<br />
of that sacrifice<br />
already made in Heaven.</p>

<p>Sacrifice,<br />
when completed,<br />
gives rise to the birth of Love<br />
both unconditional<br />
and incomprehensible,<br />
a Love which can only come<br />
to be truly recognized<br />
when any mind finally,<br />
and irrevocably,<br />
chooses to awaken<br />
from the senseless dream<br />
of the dreamer.</p>

<p>It is not a love tainted<br />
by being directed<br />
to the objects of the world,<br />
nor felt only when a mind<br />
momentarily perceives a satisfaction<br />
born of the temporary <em>organization</em><br />
of the objects and events it embraces,<br />
for no such love<br />
is truly unconditional.</p>

<p>Therefore,<br />
such love perceived<br />
is not Love at all.</p>

<p>But what arises<br />
is that self-same Love<br />
that is already with us<br />
from before time <em>is</em>,<br />
the Love from which the<br />
Son of God is birthed,<br />
the Love which has already<br />
fulfilled the Atonement<br />
required by the brief -<br />
and meaningless -<br />
thought of separation.</p>

<p>It is that Love<br />
which <em>is</em><br />
the very presence of God,<br />
who is Love itself,<br />
and <em>only</em> this.</p>

<p>Love seeks not for itself,<br />
but finds its completion<br />
in its eternal<br />
and unreserved extension.</p>

<p>It is a Love<br />
enacted by the Son<br />
which unceasingly mirrors<br />
the Love by which the Father<br />
has begotten the Son.</p>

<p>It is a Love<br />
which gives when asked<br />
and holds nothing for itself.</p>

<p>It is a Love<br />
that embraces all things,<br />
for it sees no separation<br />
in the whole of Creation.</p>

<p>It is a Love<br />
that touches all who behold it<br />
with a gentleness and certainty<br />
whose taste is sweet above honey;<br />
it quenches the thirst of the soul.</p>

<p>And this,<br />
without effort,<br />
for it is a Love<br />
that extends from -<br />
and to -<br />
true Being.</p>

<p>Seeing naught but the substance<br />
of what alone is Real<br />
in all that its eyes rest upon,<br />
it severs with the sword of wisdom<br />
the stranglehold of illusions<br />
from the heart<br />
of the one who beholds<br />
the person of the arisen Christ.</p>

<p>It is not a Love<br />
to be created,<br />
but a Love that has finally<br />
<em>been allowed</em>,<br />
rising without resistance<br />
from the soil of perfect surrender.</p>

<p>The dreamer,<br />
vanquished and reborn,<br />
decrees:</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>I live,<br />
yet not I,<br />
but Christ,<br />
dwells as me.</p>
</div>

<p>And the Word is made flesh,<br />
and dwells among us.</p>

<p><em>In</em> the world,<br />
but not <em>of</em> the world,<br />
for the world is overcome<br />
not by effort,<br />
but by Grace…<br />
the simple correction<br />
of one mistaken perception.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>Who, then,
is the servant?<br />
What is she likened unto?</p>

<p>The servant is <em>free</em>.<br />
No longer fettered<br />
to the tiny fears<br />
once seen as unscalable walls<br />
reaching to block<br />
the Light of the Son,<br />
he loves not the things of the world,<br />
for they hold no value.</p>

<p>The servant is <em>humble</em>.<br />
No longer fettered<br />
to the false arrogance<br />
that once was made<br />
to shield her from her aloneness,<br />
she clings not to false knowledge,<br />
for she knows that <em>she does not know</em>,<br />
nor does she need to.<br />
Trusting all things,<br />
allowing all things,<br />
she transcends all things<br />
by first loving and embracing<br />
all things.<br />
And their passing<br />
leaves not a trace upon her.</p>

<p>The servant is <em>capable</em>.<br />
With no anxiety<br />
for the things of tomorrow,<br />
he enacts<br />
the incomprehensible Love<br />
of the Father <em>in this moment</em>.<br />
Innocent as a child,<br />
he considers not limitation,<br />
for he sees with certainty that:</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>The works I do<br />
you also shall do,<br />
and greater works than these<br />
shall you do.</p>
</div>

<p>He knows simply<br />
that of himself he does nothing,<br />
but the Father through him<br />
does all things.<br />
Where could incapacity arise?</p>

<p>Emptied of herself,<br />
the servant effortlessly<br />
dons the cloak<br />
given her of the Father,<br />
whether the cloak of this world<br />
or another.<br />
She moves freely<br />
between Heaven and Earth,<br />
rejoicing always<br />
as the embodiment<br />
of prayer without ceasing:<br />
“Holy Father, <em>now</em> there is Light!”</p>

<p>The servant<br />
is likened unto one<br />
who has journeyed to a distant land,<br />
for his master had commanded him:</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>Go, and share with all<br />
who have ears to hear<br />
and eyes to see.</p>

  <p>Give to them of my abundance,<br />
and give freely.</p>
</div>

<p>Now,<br />
when the servant heard,<br />
she went immediately forth<br />
and was found -<br />
from waking to sleeping -<br />
to be doing<br />
as her master had asked.</p>

<p>And it came to pass<br />
that many who received<br />
secretly laughed<br />
at the folly of the servant.<br />
Many thought him mad,<br />
and many more<br />
either lost or discarded<br />
what he shared with them.</p>

<p>Only a few,<br />
having heard,<br />
received what was given to them<br />
and went and did likewise,<br />
for in their hearing<br />
they became like the servant,<br />
and what they gave away<br />
was returned to them tenfold.</p>

<p>So joyous in her task<br />
was the servant<br />
that she could hear not<br />
the judgments of the small-minded.</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>Will you choose to have ears to hear?</p>
</div>

<p>The servant<br />
is one who has<br />
transcended history.</p>

<p>Quite literally,<br />
she looks upon her past<br />
and sees it, indeed,<br />
as having <em>passed</em> away,<br />
dissolved as mist<br />
before the arising sun<br />
from deep and forested valleys.</p>

<p>Not one dark corner remains<br />
in the valleys of the mind,<br />
cut and shaped by the forces<br />
of limiting thought.</p>

<p>Rivers of radiant Light<br />
flow unimpeded now,<br />
emanating from the ocean of God’s Love,<br />
cascading waterfalls of vision<br />
that embrace the whole of Creation.</p>

<p>Though disguised in simplicity,<br />
the servant sees<br />
his every loving gesture<br />
touching the farthest star,<br />
and participating in the miracle<br />
of the Atonement.</p>

<p>The servant<br />
always recognizes his own.<br />
Herein is revealed<br />
the true body of Christ,<br />
the mystical Church<br />
which far transcends<br />
the loftiest of theologies.<br />
Herein is revealed<br />
the essence of brotherhood.</p>

<p>The servant<br />
seeks out her own<br />
and celebrates with them<br />
<em>without ceasing</em>,<br />
for awakened minds<br />
are eternally joined as one.</p>

<p>The servant is <em>gentle</em>.<br />
Clinging not<br />
to what is not given her to do,<br />
neither anger<br />
nor impatience<br />
arises.</p>

<p>The servant <em>trusts</em>.<br />
Embracing all things,<br />
having given the world<br />
up to his Father,<br />
he is content in <em>this</em> moment.<br />
The whole is present in the part,<br />
and the part embraces the whole.<br />
Forgetting not Heaven,<br />
he blesses Earth,<br />
and even his smile illuminates the world.</p>

<p>With nothing to do,<br />
she does nothing.<br />
With all things to do,<br />
she accomplishes all things -<br />
yet sees not a trace of distinction<br />
between these.</p>

<p>The servant is at <em>peace</em>.<br />
But more:<br />
he <em>is</em> peace.</p>

<p>Receiving doubt,<br />
he returns Love.<br />
Receiving judgment,<br />
she returns Love.<br />
Receiving the projections of fear,<br />
he returns Love.<br />
Receiving love<br />
not yet made wholly pure,<br />
she returns Love.</p>

<p>Receiving Love<br />
given purely,<br />
he allows himself to receive it.</p>

<p>Abiding in unbroken union<br />
with God,<br />
she receives Love<br />
without ceasing.</p>

<p>Though the world gives<br />
and takes away,<br />
his cup is always filled;<br />
he drinks deeply with every breath.<br />
Satiated,<br />
he laughs at the world’s illusions,<br />
and his laughter heals the world.</p>

<p>The servant<br />
is simply incomprehensible<br />
to the perceptions of the world.<br />
For where the world perceives lack,<br />
the servant knows unlimited abundance.<br />
Where the world perceives struggle,<br />
the servant knows perfect harmony.<br />
Where the world perceives<br />
the pressure of time,<br />
the servant knows the grace of eternity.</p>

<p>No reconciliation is possible,<br />
for the things of Heaven and Earth<br />
shall pass away,<br />
but the things of God shall not.</p>

<p>And the first -<br />
made so by the worldshall<br />
be last.</p>

<p>The last -<br />
being the creation of God -<br />
shall again be made first<br />
in the mind of the awakened<br />
joyous,<br />
servant of God,<br />
<em>who is but Love</em>.</p>

<p>As it was in the beginning,<br />
is now,<br />
and forever shall be.<br /></p>

<p>What, then,<br />
can the qualities<br />
of genuine service<br />
be likened unto?<br />
Observe the waters<br />
that flow from the highest mountains,<br />
winding, cascading, twisting, churning,<br />
resting inevitably in the sea.</p>

<p>Their destination<br />
is neither hoped for, nor imagined.<br />
It is <em>known</em>,<br />
resting always in certainty.<br />
And once the journey has begun,<br />
the end is certain.</p>

<p>The river begins<br />
as but a drop of rain<br />
that falls from the heavens<br />
freely given.</p>

<p>It forms itself in places unseen<br />
and is shaped into a constant flow<br />
that is not interrupted.</p>

<p>Seemingly shaped by the earth it touches,<br />
it becomes the shaper of waterfalls<br />
and canyons;<br />
and what river of living waters<br />
does not speak of beauty<br />
to its beholder?</p>

<p>The river nurtures<br />
all that it touches<br />
with the very sustenance of Life.<br />
It recognizes not obstacles to its journey,<br />
but -<br />
by embracing them -<br />
overcomes them.<br />
Even the sound of its passing<br />
brings respite to those who listen.</p>

<p>It laments not<br />
when others draw from it,<br />
seemingly without gratitude,<br />
for it knows its Source to be unlimited.</p>

<p>The secret of its peace,<br />
and of its certain power, is this:<br />
<em>It already abides at one with the sea</em>,<br />
having arisen from it,<br />
and returning always to it.</p>

<p>No veil of illusion<br />
has arisen in its being<br />
to create a sense of separation.<br />
Therefore,<br />
its journey begins in its certain end.</p>

<p>Let your service be given<br />
like unto the rivers of life<br />
that flow from the highest mountains<br />
to the sea.</p>

<p>Think not <em>you</em> must know<br />
the nature of the journey,<br />
nor that <em>you</em> must judge<br />
whether the twists and turns<br />
are acceptable.</p>

<p>For unto you there is given<br />
the gift of one teacher<br />
whose guidance never errs.<br />
His Voice is certain,<br />
his presence eternal.<br />
Have I not said unto you:<br />
“I will send you a Comforter?”</p>

<p>Yet,<br />
the one whom I send<br />
was received by me of our Father.<br />
Because I have received Him,<br />
He is given unto you equally.<br />
Like an ancient melody,<br />
his Voice is as a gentle song<br />
at once familiar;<br />
silence is the threshold<br />
that carries the heart<br />
to the inner chamber of the Holy One.</p>

<p>To give truly,<br />
one must give all they have.</p>

<p>For to give<br />
while holding one part back<br />
is to believe one has <em>not</em> all things.<br />
And to she who believes she has not,<br />
much will be taken,<br />
while to she who knows she has all,<br />
even more shall be added,<br />
and her giving shall be unlimited<br />
and without end.</p>

<p class="indent">She who gives all receives all.</p>

<p>The true servant gives even this:<br />
all traces of attachment<br />
to the fruit of her giving.<br />
For her giving has been already seen<br />
to be from the Father,<br />
and so the fruits are given to her.</p>

<p>Thus the servant proclaims:<br />
“Why do you call me good?<br />
There is only one who is good:<br />
God, who is but Love.<br />
And if you would truly receive<br />
what I would give you,<br />
go, and do likewise.”</p>

<p>Hear again:</p>

<p class="indent">He who gives all, receives all.</p>

<p>The servant<br />
gives as he has been given,<br />
but remembers it not.<br />
Caring not for the accolades of the world,<br />
he collects no ribbons,<br />
and keeps no trophy.<br />
But the face of Christ<br />
seen in each he serves<br />
is etched in his awareness forever;<br />
he remembers them<br />
and gives thanks to the Father,<br />
for the servant lives<br />
the simplest of truths:</p>

<p class="indent">My brothers and sisters are my salvation.</p>

<p>The servant knows she fixes nothing.<br />
Seeing not a fearful world,<br />
she does not deliver it from “evil.”<br />
Looking not upon illness,<br />
she calls not herself a healer.</p>

<p>Herein,<br />
learn the secret of the miraculous:<br />
The servant does nothing<br />
save to extend Love<br />
to the Christ who dwells in another,<br />
having learned to see<br />
past the appearances<br />
that are the world;<br />
and the one who is ill<br />
recognizes that the servant<br />
has recognized her<br />
<em>as she is</em>, and decrees:<br />
“I am seen as I AM,<br />
and release my illusions now.”</p>

<p>Love heals,<br />
and Love alone.</p>

<p>Those unaccustomed to miracles<br />
run after the servant, asking:<br />
“How do you do these things?”<br />
To which the servant replies:<br />
“Love has done these things.<br />
Of myself,<br />
I only asked that my Father<br />
correct my perception of you.”</p>

<p>Love will flow through any mind<br />
that asks for<br />
and allows<br />
the correction of its perceptions.</p>

<p>How, then,<br />
does the servant serve?</p>

<p>By being <em>only</em> the presence of Love.</p>

<p>The extension of Love,<br />
untainted by the thought of a doer,<br />
is the quality of genuine service,<br />
a reflection in this world<br />
of the Love which begets eternally<br />
the holy and only begotten child of God.</p>
