    <p>We now review again. This time we are ready to give more effort and more
time to what we undertake. We recognize we are preparing for another
phase of understanding. We would take this step completely, that we may
go on again more certain, more sincere, with faith upheld more surely.
Our footsteps have not been unwavering, and doubts have made us walk
uncertainly and slowly on the road this course sets forth. But now we
hasten on, for we approach a greater certainty, a firmer purpose and a
surer goal.</p>

<p>Steady our feet, our Father; let our doubts be quiet and our holy minds
be still, and speak to us. We have no words to give to You. We would but
listen to Your Word and make it ours. Lead our practicing as does a
father lead a little child along a way he does not understand. Yet does
he follow, sure that he is safe because his father leads the way for
him.</p>

<p>So do we bring our practicing to You. And if we stumble, You will raise
us up. If we forget the way, we count upon Your sure remembering. We
wander off, but You will not forget to call us back. Quicken our
footsteps now, that we may walk more certainly and quickly unto You. And
we accept the Word You offer us to unify our practicing, as we review
the thoughts that You have given us.</p>

<p>This is the thought which should precede the thoughts that we review.
Each one but clarifies some aspect of this thought, or helps it be more
meaningful, more personal and true, and more descriptive of the holy
Self we share and now prepare to know again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“God is but Love, and therefore so am I.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This Self alone knows love. This Self alone is perfectly consistent in
Its thoughts; knows Its Creator, understands Itself, is perfect in Its
knowledge and Its love, and never changes from Its constant state of
union with Its Father and Itself.</p>

<p>And it is This that waits to meet us at the journey’s ending. Every step
we take brings us a little nearer. This review will shorten time
immeasurably if we keep in mind that This remains our goal, and as we
practice it is This to which we are approaching. Let us raise
our hearts from dust to life as we remember This is promised us, and
that this course was sent to open up the path of light to us, and teach
us, step by step, how to return to the Eternal Self we thought we lost.</p>

<p>I take the journey with you. For I share your doubts and fears a little
while, that you may come to me who recognize the road by which all fears
and doubts are overcome. We walk together. I must understand uncertainty
and pain, although I know they have no meaning. Yet a Savior must remain
with those he teaches, seeing what they see, but still retaining in his
mind the way that led him out, and now will lead you out with him. God’s
Son is crucified until you walk along the road with me.</p>

<p>My resurrection comes again each time I lead a brother safely to the
place at which the journey ends and is forgot. I am renewed each time a
brother learns there is a way from misery and pain. I am reborn each
time a brother’s mind turns to the light in him and looks for me. I have
forgotten no-one. Help me now to lead you back to where the journey was
begun, to make another choice with me.</p>

<p>Release me as you practice once again the thoughts I brought to you from
Him Who sees your bitter need, and knows the answer God has given
Him. Together we review these thoughts. Together we devote our time and
effort to them. And together we will teach them to our brothers. God
would not have Heaven incomplete. It waits for you as I do. I am
incomplete without your part in me. And as I am made whole, we go
together to our ancient home, prepared for us before time was and kept
unchanged by time, immaculate and safe, as it will be at last, when time
is done.</p>

<p>Let this review be then your gift to me. For this alone I need; that you
will hear the words I speak and give them to the world. You are my voice,
my eyes, my feet, my hands, through which I save the world. The Self
from Which I call to you is but your Own. To Him we go together. Take
your brother’s hand, for this is not a way we walk alone. In him I walk
with you and you with me. Our Father wills His Son be One with Him. What
lives but must not then be one with you?</p>

<p>Let this review become a time in which we share a new experience for
you, yet one as old as time, and older still. Hallowed your name. Your
glory undefiled forever. And your wholeness now complete, as God
established it. You are His Son, completing His
extension in your own. We practice but an ancient truth we knew before
illusion seemed to claim the world. And we remind the world that it is
free of all illusions every time we say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“God is but Love, and therefore so am I.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this we start each day of our review. With this we start and end
each period of practice time. And with this thought we sleep, to waken
once again with these same words upon our lips to greet another day. No
thought that we review but we surround with it, and use the thoughts to
hold it up before our minds, and keep it clear in our remembrance
throughout the day. And thus when we have finished this review, we will
have recognized the words we speak are true.</p>

<p>Yet are the words but aids and to be used, except at the beginning and
the end of practice periods, but to recall the mind, as needed, to its
purpose. We place faith in the experience that comes from practice, not
the means we use. We wait for the experience, and recognize that it is
only here conviction lies. We use the words, and try and try again to go
beyond them to their meaning, which is far beyond their sound. The sound
grows dim and disappears as we approach the Source of meaning. It is
Here that we find rest.</p>
