  <div class="manual transcript ui text container">
  
    <p>This manual is not intended to answer all questions that both teacher
and pupil may raise. In fact, it covers only a few of the more obvious
ones, in terms of a brief summary of some of the major concepts in the
text and workbook. It is not a substitute for either, but merely a
supplement. While it is called a manual for teachers, it must be
remembered that only time divides teacher and pupil, so that the
difference is temporary by definition. In some cases, it may be helpful
for the pupil to read the manual first. Others might do better to begin
with the workbook. Still others may need to start at the more abstract
levels of the text.</p>

<p>Which is for whom? Who would profit more from prayers alone? Who needs
but a smile, being as yet unready for more? No-one should attempt to
answer these questions alone. Surely no teacher of God has come this far
without realizing that. The curriculum is highly individualized. And all
aspects are under the Holy Spirit’s particular care and guidance. Ask
and He will answer. The responsibility is His, and He alone is fit to
assume it. To do so is His function. To refer the questions to Him is
yours. Would you want to be responsible for decisions about which you
understand so little? Be glad you have a Teacher Who cannot make a
mistake. His answers are always right. Would you say that of yours?</p>

<p>There is another advantage, – and a very important one, – in referring
decisions to the Holy Spirit with increasing frequency. Perhaps you have
not thought of this aspect, but its centrality is obvious. To follow the
Holy Spirit’s guidance is to let yourself be absolved of guilt. It is
the essence of the Atonement. It is the core of the curriculum. The
imagined usurping of functions not your own is the basis of fear. The
whole world you see reflects the illusion you have done so, making fear
inevitable. To return the function to the One to Whom it belongs is thus
the escape from fear. And it is this that lets the memory of love return
to you. Do not, then, think that following the Holy Spirit’s guidance is
necessary merely because of your own inadequacies. It is the way out of
hell for you.</p>

<p>Here again is the paradox often referred to in the course. To say,
“Of myself I can do nothing” is to gain all power. And yet it is but a
seeming paradox. As God created you, you have all power. The image you
made of yourself has none. The Holy Spirit knows the truth about you. The
image you made does not. Yet despite its obvious and complete ignorance,
this image assumes it knows all things because you have given that
belief to it. Such is your teaching and the teaching of the world which
was made to uphold it. But the Teacher Who knows the truth has not
forgotten it. His decisions bring benefit to all, being wholly devoid of
attack. And therefore incapable of arousing guilt.</p>

<p>Who assumes a power that he does not have is deceiving himself. Yet to
accept the power given him by God is but to acknowledge his Creator and
accept His gifts. And His gifts have no limit. To ask the Holy Spirit to
decide for you is simply to accept your true inheritance. Does this mean
that you cannot say anything without consulting Him? No indeed! That
would hardly be practical, and it is the practical with which this
course is most concerned. If you have made it a habit to ask for help
when and where you can, you can be confident that wisdom will be given
you when you need it. Prepare for this each morning, remember God when
you can throughout the day, ask the Holy Spirit’s help when it is
feasible to do so, and thank Him for His guidance at night. And your
confidence will be well founded indeed.</p>

<p>Never forget that the Holy Spirit does not depend on your words. He
understands the requests of your heart and answers them. Does this mean
that, while attack remains attractive to you He will respond with evil?
Hardly! For God has given Him the power to translate your prayers of the
heart into His language. He understands that an attack is a call for
help. And He responds with help accordingly. God would be cruel if He
let your words replace His Own. A loving father does not let his child
harm himself or choose his own destruction. He may ask for injury, but
his father will protect him still. And how much more than this does your
Father love His Son?</p>

<p>Remember you are His completion and His Love. Remember your weakness is
His strength. But do not read this hastily or wrongly. If His strength
is in you, what you perceive as your weakness is but illusion. And He
has given you the means to prove it
so. Ask all things of His Teacher, and all things are given you. Not in
the future but immediately; now. God does not wait, for waiting implies
time and He is timeless. Forget your foolish images, your sense of
frailty and your fear of harm, your dreams of danger and selected
“wrongs.” God knows but His Son, and as he was created so he is. In
confidence I place you in His hands, and I give thanks for you that this
is so.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And now in all your doings be you blessed.<br />
God turns to you for help to save the world.<br />
Teacher of God, His thanks He offers you,<br />
And all the world stands silent in the grace<br />
You bring from Him. You are the Son He loves,<br />
And it is given you to be the means<br />
Through which His Voice is heard around the world<br />
To close all things of time, to end the sight<br />
Of all things visible, and to undo<br />
All things that change. Through you is ushered in<br />
A world unseen, unheard, yet truly there.<br />
Holy are you, and in your light the world<br />
Reflects your holiness, for you are not<br />
Alone and friendless. I give thanks for you,<br />
And join your efforts on behalf of God,<br />
Knowing they are on my behalf as well<br />
And for all those who walk to God with me.</p>

  <p>FINIS</p>
</blockquote>
