    <p>4.1 Do you have to love God to know what love is? When you love purely,
you know God whether you realize it or not. What does it mean to love
purely? It means to love for love’s sake. To simply love. To have no
false idols.</p>

<p>4.2 False idols must be brought to light and there seen as the nothing
that they are before you can love for love’s sake. What is a false idol?
What you think love will get you. You are entitled to all that love
would give but not to what you think love will provide for you through
its acquisition. This is a classic example of not recognizing that love
is.</p>

<p>4.3 Love and longing are so intimately attached because they joined
together at the moment of separation when a choice to go away from love
and a choice to return were birthed in unison. Love was thus not ever
lost but shadowed over by longing that, placed between you and your
Source, both obscured Its light and alerted you of Its eternal presence.
Longing is your proof of love’s existence, for even here you would not
long for what is not remembered.</p>

<p>4.4 All your long search for proof of God’s existence ends here when
you recognize what love is. And with this proof is proof of your
existence established as well. For in your longing for love, you
recognize as well your longing for your Self. Why would you wonder who
you are and what your purpose here is all about, if not for your
recognition, given witness by your longing, of what you fear you are
not, but surely are?</p>

<p>4.5 All fear ends when proof of your existence is established. All fear
is based on your inability to recognize love and thus who you are and
who God is. How could you not have been fearful with doubt as powerful
as this? How can you not rejoice when doubt is gone and love fills all
the space that doubt once occupied? No shadows linger when doubt is
gone. Nothing stands between the child of God and the child’s own
Source. There remain no clouds to block the sun, and night gives way to
day.</p>

<p>4.6 Child of God, you are alien here but need not be alien to your Self.
In your knowledge of your Self, all threat of time and space and place
dissolves. You may still walk an alien land, but not in a fog of
amnesia that obscures what would be a brief adventure and replaces it
with dreams of terror and confusion so rampant that no toehold of
security is possible, and day turns endlessly into night in a long march
toward death. Recognize who you are and God’s light goes before you,
illuminating every path and shining away the fog of dreams from which
you waken undisturbed.</p>

<p>4.7 Love alone has the power to turn this dream of death into a waking
awareness of life eternal.</p>

<p>4.8 Yearning, learning, seeking, acquiring, the need to own, the need
to keep, the grasping call, the driving force, the chosen passion—all
these things that you have made to replace what you already have will
lead you back as surely as they can lead you astray. Where what you have
made will lead rests only on your decision. Your decision, couched in
many forms, is simply this: to proceed toward love or to withdraw from
it, to believe it is given or withheld.</p>

<p>4.9 Love is all that follows the law of God in your world. All else
assumes that what one has is denied another. While love cannot be
learned nor practiced, there is a practice we must do in order to
recognize love’s presence. We practice living by the law of love, a law
of gain not loss, a law that says the more you give the more you gain.</p>

<p>4.10 There are no losers and no winners under God’s law. Not one is
given more than another. God cannot love you more than your neighbor,
nor can you earn more of God’s love than you have, or a better place in
Heaven. The mind, under the ego’s direction, has thrived on winners and
on losers, on striving for and earning a better place. The heart knows
not these distinctions, and those who think their hearts have learned
them by being battered and abused by their experience here, rejoice in
knowing that it is not so. This seeming illusion is believed in because
your mind has made it so. Your thoughts have reviewed and reviewed
again all the pain that love has brought. It dwells on those occasions
when love has failed because it does not recognize that love cannot
fail.</p>

<p>4.11 Your expectations and false perceptions of your brothers and
sisters are what have caused you to believe that love can fail, be lost,
withdrawn, or turned to hate. Your false perception of your Father is
what has caused all other perceptions to be false, including the one you
hold of your own Self.</p>

<p>4.12 When you think of acting out of love, your thoughts of love are
based on sentiment and must be challenged. Love is not being nice when
you are feeling surly. Love is not doing good deeds of charity and
service. Love is not throwing logic to the wind and acting in foolish
ways that pass as gaiety but cannot masquerade as joy. You each have an
image in your mind of someone you believe knows what love is. This is
perhaps an elderly person who is always kind and gentle, with no cross
word for anyone, and no concern for his or her own self. This is perhaps
a mother whose love is blind and self-sacrificing. Still others of you
might imagine a couple long married in which each person is devoted to
the other’s happiness, or a father whose love is unconditional, or a
priest or minister who guides unfailingly. For each or any one of these
that you admire, you give attributes that you do not have and that you
might one day acquire when the time is right. For that kind and gentle
stance you do not believe will serve you now, that blindness and
self-sacrifice is something to be gained at too high a price, that
devotion you might think is fine for one whose partner is more loving
than your own, that unconditional love is great, but must it not be
tempered by good judgment? And surely that ability to guide others must
be earned through the acquisition of wisdom not within your reach.</p>

<p>4.13 Thus, your image of love is based upon comparison. You have
chosen one who demonstrates that which in you is most lacking and you
use that image to chastise yourself while saying this is what you want.</p>

<p>4.14 Your ideas of being in love are quite another category all
together. In this context love is not only full of sentiment but of
romance. This stage of love is seldom seen as lasting or as something
that can be maintained. It is the purview of the young, and the daydream
of the aging. It is synonymous with passion and an overflow of feelings
that defy all common sense. To be in love is to be vulnerable, for once
common sense has failed to keep you acting as expected, you might forget
to guard your heart or to keep your real Self in hiding. How dangerous
indeed is such an act in a world where trust can turn to treachery.</p>

<p>4.15 Each one of you has held an ideal of what the perfect mate would
mean, an ideal that changed over time. Those most bound by the ego might
think of stature and of wealth, of physical beauty and the trappings of
good upbringing. Those most insecure will believe in a partner who would
shower him or her with praise and gifts, with attention never wavering.
Another who prizes independence seeks a partner in good health, not too
demanding, a companion and a lover who will be convenient within a busy
life.</p>

<p>4.16 You believe you can fall in love with the wrong person and make a
better choice based upon criteria more important than love. You thus
believe love is a choice, something to be given to some and not to
others. You hope to be a winner in this game you play, a chosen one who
will have each ounce of love that is given returned in kind. This is a
balancing act you play with God’s most holy gift, resenting giving love
that gains you little in return. And yet in this resentment you
recognize the truth of what love is.</p>

<p>4.17 In no other area of life do you expect such fairness, such
exchange of equal value. You give your mind to an idea, your body to a
job, your days to activities that do not interest or fulfill you. You
accept what you are paid within certain boundaries you have set; you
expect that a certain amount of prestige will follow certain
accomplishments; you accept that some tasks have to be done for
survival’s sake. You hope there will be some fairness here in what you
give and what you are given back. You hope your hard work will produce
results, the dinner you prepared be eaten with delight, your ideas
greeted as inspired. But this you do not expect. You often, in fact,
expect the reverse to be the case, and are grateful for each
acknowledgment the world gives you for the ways in which you spend your
days. For spend your days you do, and soon that spending will deplete
the limited number of days in store for you and you will die. Life is
not fair, nor meant to be, you claim. But love is something else.</p>

<p>4.18 In this you are correct, for love is nothing like your image of
your life and has no resemblance to how you spend your days or the way
your days will end. Love is all that is set apart in your perception
from what you do here. You think this setting apart gives love little
relevance to other areas of your life. Love is seen as personal,
something another gives in a special way to you alone, and you to him or
her. Your love life has nothing to do with your work life, your issues
of survival here, your ability to achieve success, or the state of your
health and general welfare.</p>

<p>4.19 Even you who do not recognize what love is protect what you call
love from the illusions you have made.</p>

<p>4.20 A thing set apart from the madness of the world is useful now. It
may not be what love is, but what love is has guided you in choosing to
set love apart from what you call the real world, from that which is, in
fact, the sum total of what you have made. The world you struggle so to
navigate is what you have made it, a place where love fits not and
enters not in truth. But love has entered you and leaves you not, and so
you too must have no place in this world that you have made but must
have another where you are at home and can abide within love’s presence.</p>

<p>4.21 The lucky ones among you have made a place resembling home within
your world. It is where you keep love locked away behind closed doors.
It is where you return after your forays into the world that you have
made and upon entering believe you leave the world’s madness outside
your door. Here you feel safe and gather those you love around you. Here
you share your day’s adventures, making sense of what you can and
leaving out the rest, and here you gain the strength you need to walk
outside those doors again another day. You spend your life intent upon
retiring to this safe place you have made of love in a world of madness,
and hope that you will live to see the day when you can leave the
madness behind, and that you will still find love behind the doors you
have passed through so many times in a journey spent earning your right
to leave it no more.</p>

<p>4.22 Some would call such a life selfish and wonder how the occupants
of this semi-happy dream have earned the right to turn their backs upon
the world even for the scanty hours that they make believe they can do
so. Fullscale interaction with the world of madness is all that some are
willing to accept of others or themselves. These are the angry ones who
would demand that others bring what love they have into the madness to
take responsibility for the mess that has been made, to attempt to
restore order to chaos, anything so that the angry ones feel less alone
with what their anger shows them. Love, they say, cannot be set apart,
and so they feel love not, nor see it either. Yet they too recognize
love for what it is when they scream, “You cannot have it while all of
these do not. You cannot hoard it to yourself when so many are in need.”</p>

<p>4.23 Everywhere you look is proof of love’s difference found. This
difference is your salvation. Love is not like anything or everything
else that goes on here. And so your places to worship love have been
built, your sacraments protect love’s holiness, your homes host those
you love most dearly.</p>

<p>4.24 Thus has your perception of love prepared you for what love is.
For within you is the altar for your worship, within you has love’s
holiness been protected, within you abides the Host who loves all
dearly. Within you is the light that will show you what love is and keep
it not set apart from life any longer. Love cannot be brought to the
world of madness, nor the world of madness brought to love. But love can
allow a new world to be seen, a world that will allow you to abide
within love’s presence.</p>

<p>4.25 Take all the images of love set apart that you have made and
extend them outside love’s doors. What difference would a world of love
make to those who lock their doors upon the world? How vast the reaches
where their world of love could extend once love joined the world. How
little need for the angry ones to retain their anger when love has
joined the world. For love does join the world, and it is within this
joining that love abides, holy as itself.</p>

<p>4.26 The world is but a reflection of your inner life, the reality
unseen and unprepared for by all your strategy and defenses. You prepare
for everything that goes on outside yourself and nothing that occurs
within. Yet it is a joining that occurs within that brings about the
joining of all the world for all the world to see. This joining of the
world within is but your recognition of what love is, safe and secure
within you and your brother, as you join together in truth. Think you
not that this joining is a metaphor, a string of pleasant words that
will bring you comfort if you heed them, one more sentiment in a world
where lovely words replace what they would mean. This joining is the
goal you seek, the only goal worthy of love’s call.</p>

<p>4.27 This goal is set apart from all others as love is here, a goal
that touches not on what you perceive to be a loveless world. It has no
relation to the world outside of you, but every relation to the world
within, where in love’s presence both outer and inner worlds become as
one and leave beyond your vision the world that you have seen and called
your home. This foreign world where you have been so lonely and afraid
will linger for a while where it can terrify you no longer, until
finally it will fade away into the nothingness from which it came as a
new world rises up to take its place.</p>
