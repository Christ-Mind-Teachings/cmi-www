<p class="top"><span class="dropcaps">S</span><em>ervantship</em><br />
It appears an odd word,<br />
yet within it lies the meaning of sacrifice,<br />
of Love,<br />
of true Being.</p>

<p>Servantship is a <em>vocation</em><br />
to which one is called,<br />
not by a God who exists apart from you,<br />
but by that one true God<br />
who abides eternally<br />
in the Heart of one’s heart,<br />
and is forever the Soul of one’s soul.</p>

<p>For the one true God<br />
is your only Reality,<br />
and in this does the recognition dawn<br />
that <em>you</em> -<br />
who would insist<br />
on the smallness of yourself<br />
as you have dreamt it to be -<br />
contain, in truth, all wisdom;<br />
that <em>you</em><br />
contain all perfections<br />
holy men would so diligently seek<br />
and ignorant men would mistakenly seek<br />
in the destitution<br />
of their worldly dreams.</p>

<p>That one true God<br />
to whom you are eternally united,<br />
so that no boundary between you<br />
can be distinguished,<br />
is that which has sustained<br />
the infinite forms<br />
of your dreams,<br />
their incessant creation fueled<br />
by the one thought of separation.</p>

<p>And now,<br />
in the time of Recognition,<br />
after the allure of the dream has paled<br />
and finally lost all trace of significance,<br />
and in that perfect silence<br />
where the sleeping Son no longer rebels<br />
against the simple<br />
and loving<br />
embrace of the Holy Father,<br />
the light of the living Christ is rekindled.</p>

<p>As a flame in a windless place,<br />
its light grows ever brighter,<br />
dissolving all traces of the shadows<br />
which have kept it hidden,<br />
lighting up the dark places<br />
where the dust which is the world<br />
has settled,<br />
until even the dust is dissolved<br />
and becomes as Light itself.</p>

<p>The doer is undone.<br />
The maker of the world is unmade,<br />
and Christ again,<br />
lives.</p>

<p>Here,<br />
the end of all fruitless journeying.</p>

<p>Here,<br />
the ceasing of all strife.</p>

<p>Here,<br />
the realization of the only Truth,<br />
beyond all utterance,<br />
beyond the understanding of the world,<br />
beyond even the dream<br />
of the one who would seek God.</p>

<p>For the seeker is no more,<br />
as if he had never been,<br />
save as a fading memory of a dream<br />
dreamt long ago.</p>

<p>Returned to the embrace<br />
of our Holy Father,<br />
the one who has returned acknowledges:<br />
“I AM that One.”</p>

<p><em>Christ lives, and Christ alone.</em></p>

<p>As it is,<br />
has been,<br />
and forever shall be.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>The awakened Heart<br />
is likened unto one<br />
who has journeyed<br />
to the summit<br />
of the highest mountain.</p>

<p>Here,<br />
she looks out upon<br />
the distances traveled,<br />
the many landscapes<br />
stretching out below her,<br />
the seemingly infinite shapes and hues.</p>

<p>She beholds all the worlds of mankind,<br />
and sees them as empty,<br />
as a moment’s diversion,<br />
fragments of but one dream.</p>

<p>She beholds herself as the one dreamer,<br />
and she would that<br />
every vestige of herself<br />
be nudged from sleep to waking.</p>

<p>And now,<br />
the transformation is completed.</p>

<p>Resting in the Light of Remembrance,<br />
embraced eternally<br />
in the arms of his Father,<br />
the only begotten Son abides<br />
in the Kingdom<br />
prepared for him<br />
in that most ancient<br />
beginning before time is.</p>

<p>Her will has become<br />
as her Father’s.<br />
United again as one,<br />
the first movement of that Divine Will<br />
stirs in the vision before her.</p>

<p>Compassion arises<br />
for the whole of Creation<br />
and she sees without effort<br />
the task set before her:<br />
the awakening of the whole of herself,<br />
now recognized as every soul,<br />
every blade of grass,<br />
every wisp of breeze.</p>

<p>Awakened<br />
as the source of all things,<br />
existing in all things,<br />
the one Son,<br />
united with the Holy Father -<br />
the brief dream of the Prodigal Son<br />
vanquished -<br />
looks out upon himself<br />
with but one desire: Awaken!</p>

<p>Restored to her rightful place<br />
at the right hand of the Holy Father,<br />
purified of all distortions<br />
born of a moment’s dream, <br />
a movement begins.</p>

<p>Felt in the heart,<br />
it expands first upward,<br />
upward beyond the crown of the head,<br />
then outward,<br />
filling every cell<br />
of a body transfigured,<br />
brought evermore<br />
to the form of a vehicle<br />
that will serve only the fulfillment<br />
of her task.</p>

<p>And then,<br />
when the Father and the Son together<br />
have prepared<br />
the body and mind of Christ,<br />
the movement of Divine Will<br />
becomes <em>downward</em>,<br />
compelling the arisen Christ to step<br />
deliberately and without haste<br />
in the direction of all that now lies<br />
before Him,<br />
far below Him,<br />
spread as far as the eye can see,<br />
slumbering at the base<br />
of this great Mount Zion.</p>

<p>Now,<br />
her steps<br />
become more certain.</p>

<p>Now,<br />
his steps<br />
become ever lighter,<br />
unburdened from the weight<br />
of a self that never was,<br />
yet clamored for a food<br />
which never satisfied.</p>

<p>Now,<br />
her steps<br />
become ever more directed<br />
from a source perfectly trusted,<br />
and with each step,<br />
dissolving<br />
is any need to know<br />
where she goes,<br />
what she shall eat,<br />
or what she shall wear,<br />
for her Father knows<br />
she has need of these things.</p>

<p>He knows but one thing only:<br />
he goes as the wind,<br />
caring not the direction of his travels,<br />
remembering not<br />
the direction of his coming,<br />
abiding always<br />
in the Light of the Holy Father.</p>

<p>Behold!<br />
The servant is born.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p class="center omit"><em>For the first shall be last,<br />
and the last, first.</em></p>

<p>The only begotten Son dreams.<br />
And in his dream is forgotten<br />
that which eternally<br />
he <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>And the first has become last,<br />
even as the creation<br />
of innumerable worlds arises,<br />
replacing the splendor<br />
of Remembrance<br />
with the lifeless,<br />
enchanting,<br />
ever-changing forms of mere illusions.</p>

<p>And the last has become as the first.</p>

<p>Yet,<br />
within the worlds<br />
of her dream<br />
lies the crystal clear gem<br />
of Reality,<br />
for the unspeakable Love<br />
which the Father is<br />
illuminates the dream of the Son,<br />
granting her perception<br />
of all that she would <em>choose</em> to perceive.</p>

<p>And the Father merely waits,<br />
abiding wholly in the purity of his Light,<br />
seeing naught but the splendor<br />
of his Son,<br />
waiting for the one who lays dreaming<br />
to awaken.</p>

<p>The first is, indeed,<br />
now last,<br />
and what must always be last -<br />
mere illusions cast by,<br />
and within,<br />
the mind of the Son -<br />
has become first:<br />
the Kingdom is forgotten.</p>

<p>Habituated<br />
to the play of shadows,<br />
no more than projections<br />
of his momentary thought,<br />
the Son suffers the worlds<br />
of his own making,<br />
reveling in transitory pleasures,<br />
enduring the pain of countless wounds;<br />
yet he continues on,<br />
proliferating the worlds of experience,<br />
seeking ever more desperately<br />
for what he has long forgotten,<br />
knowing not what it is he seeks,<br />
calling it by various names,<br />
striving endlessly<br />
to discover his salvation<br />
in the worlds he has made,<br />
insisting it be found there.</p>

<p>And the Father waits,<br />
abiding in the purity of his Light,<br />
seeing naught but the radiant splendor<br />
of his Son.</p>

<p>The maker of the world,<br />
but not of Reality,<br />
unknowingly remains impelled<br />
to experience again and yet again<br />
the fruit of pride:<br />
vanity of vanities.</p>

<p>Insisting on her chosen thought,<br />
enmeshed<br />
in a deepening web of shadow,<br />
yet she cries out desperately<br />
in the aloneness of her soul:</p>

<p><em>“<strong>I</strong> am,<br />
<strong>I</strong> create,<br />
<strong>My</strong> will be done!”</em></p>

<p>And still,<br />
the Father waits,<br />
abiding in the purity of his Light,<br />
seeing naught but the radiant splendor<br />
of his beloved Son.</p>

<p>As the offspring of Light Divine<br />
wanders from world to world,<br />
ceaselessly moved to act,<br />
seeking<br />
without knowing he seeks,<br />
searching for the Kingdom<br />
without knowing he searches,<br />
creating and devouring the forms<br />
of his apparently endless dream,<br />
an impulse begins to grow.</p>

<p>At first unnoticed,<br />
soft,<br />
and seemingly far away,<br />
overwhelmed by the noise and conflicts<br />
of his making,<br />
it grows.</p>

<p>Through endless circles<br />
and a myriad of landscapes,<br />
ceaselessly<br />
through agonies and ecstasies<br />
disguised in infinite masks,<br />
it grows,<br />
becoming as a Voice<br />
whispering beyond the threshold<br />
of his hearing,<br />
whispering a song<br />
forever eternal,<br />
forever untouched by a single jot or tittle<br />
of all that the Son experiences.</p>

<p>It is a song<br />
of Truth beyond all doubt,<br />
a song<br />
of Reality uncompromised,<br />
a song<br />
which sings of the imperishable essence,<br />
the very essence of his being,<br />
a song which is<br />
the Love of the Holy Father.</p>

<p>Though the Voice sings the song<br />
without ceasing,<br />
the Son hears not,<br />
her ears turned not<br />
to the Voice whose song<br />
is like one crying in the wilderness,<br />
but to the din<br />
of ephemeral shadows<br />
cast upon the walls of her prison,<br />
recognizing not the Light<br />
which lights all darkness,<br />
believing still that darkness to be<br />
the Light she would seek,<br />
the Light that will illuminate her way,<br />
and reveal the treasure<br />
she believes resides there.</p>

<p>And still,<br />
the Father waits,<br />
abiding in the purity of his Light,<br />
seeing naught but the radiant splendor<br />
of his only begotten,<br />
his beloved,<br />
his Son,<br />
eternal.</p>

<p>Still,<br />
the Son travels.<br />
Through valleys<br />
of the shadow of death,<br />
climbing mountains<br />
made of the stones of uncertainties,<br />
fording rivers whose far shores<br />
often cannot be seen,<br />
rivers wild with the tumult of emotions<br />
arising like angry waves<br />
from depths already seething<br />
in memories<br />
clutched tightly in the grasp<br />
of the one who believes in shadow<br />
and worships it,<br />
knowing not that he does so.</p>

<p>And still, the Father waits,<br />
abiding always in the purity of his Light,<br />
rejoicing in the perfection of his Son,<br />
waiting for the child<br />
to make but one simple,<br />
quiet choice:<br />
to awaken!</p>

<p>As she travels on,<br />
there comes now a moment here,<br />
and again there,<br />
moments sadly fleeting,<br />
yet filled with the clarity<br />
of the song that calls unto her.</p>

<p>Were she to turn but for an instant<br />
and embrace what the moment would offer,<br />
<em>the journey would be no more</em>,<br />
the simple choice recognized,<br />
and made.</p>

<p>It is but his weariness<br />
that forces him to pause,<br />
to rest in that silence<br />
which is the doorway to his Heart,<br />
where alone fulfillment resides.</p>

<p>The treasure rests<br />
in the palm of her hand,<br />
yet she comprehends it not.</p>

<p>Habituated only<br />
to the grasping of illusion,<br />
she has not the capacity<br />
to recognize what has touched her:<br />
the Light of the Father<br />
that would loosen the knot<br />
binding her to enchantment<br />
with unceasing emptiness.</p>

<p>Believing himself restored,<br />
and himself the restorer,<br />
he plunges headlong once again,<br />
going on,<br />
going-where?</p>

<p>He mistakes his endless circling<br />
for clear direction to the finality<br />
<em>he</em> would make,<br />
failing to see he travels<br />
but the same valleys,<br />
the same mountains,<br />
the same rivers.</p>

<p>Cleverly cloaking these<br />
with her own shifting perceptions,<br />
she beguiles herself into believing<br />
not that she sees differently,<br />
but that what she sees<br />
<em>is</em> different and new.</p>

<p>And yet the Father waits,<br />
ever so patient<br />
with his beloved Son,<br />
abiding eternally in the knowledge<br />
beyond comprehension,<br />
that the dream his Son would dream<br />
in truth, exists not;<br />
rejoicing without ceasing<br />
in the radiance of his holy child,<br />
untouched eternally<br />
by the illusion of sin.</p>

<p>A deepening weariness grows<br />
in the heart of the dreamer,<br />
a weariness<br />
neither understood<br />
nor recognized<br />
by the mind accustomed to shadows,<br />
nor a body blind<br />
to the seed of Light within it.</p>

<p>The dreamer moves on,<br />
yet the weariness remains within him,<br />
unvanquished by his fruitless pause,<br />
restored not by his habitual escape<br />
from shadows.</p>

<p>Disconcerted,<br />
she moves along familiar byways,<br />
increasingly unable to blot out<br />
this persistent<br />
though subtle<br />
weariness,<br />
an ache that remains with her,<br />
no matter the form<br />
or intensity<br />
of her efforts to be free of it.</p>

<p>And now,<br />
fear arises.<br />
It is a fear unlike<br />
any he has experienced<br />
within his countless journeys<br />
in the fields of illusions.</p>

<p>Not a fear<br />
from which he can hide,<br />
nor a fear<br />
he can successfully suppress<br />
by heaping upon it<br />
the weight of evermore enchantments.</p>

<p>It is a fear<br />
to which she is unaccustomed,<br />
for it stems not<br />
from her experience of the world,<br />
but grows quietly from<br />
and remains present within<br />
the core of her being.</p>

<p>Intensifying his efforts<br />
to find solace in the changing landscapes<br />
of his dreams<br />
serves only to confirm<br />
the reality of his fear.</p>

<p>Unlike anything<br />
she has yet encountered,<br />
this fear becomes a constant<br />
though unwelcome<br />
companion.</p>

<p>It becomes as a child<br />
who increasingly refuses to be ignored,<br />
and the dreamer of a thousand worlds,<br />
proud author<br />
of a multitude of illusions,<br />
survivor of numerous heavens and hells,<br />
trembles.</p>

<p>In his trembling,<br />
he does not pause in his vain pursuits<br />
as much as he is <em>made</em> to stop,<br />
and looking at<br />
what he would resist seeing,<br />
he beholds:<br />
The salt of the world<br />
has begun to lose its savor.</p>

<p>Weariness<br />
perceived as fear<br />
appears to her as an unknown force<br />
from which she cannot hide,<br />
yet cannot embrace.<br />
It seems to run before her<br />
as she scampers first up one hill,<br />
greeting her face-to-face at the summit,<br />
and fording rivers<br />
swum countless times before,<br />
she emerges only to find it<br />
waiting on the far shore.</p>

<p>Beginning to sense<br />
that this unknown force<br />
is not to be cast aside,<br />
the dreamer laments within himself,<br />
and in the midst of all his doing,<br />
the faint echo of a sound<br />
he has forever dreaded<br />
is heard.</p>

<p>The doer of all deeds is shaken,<br />
the foundation of his creations<br />
wobbles and weakens;<br />
he beholds the force within himself<br />
and,<br />
for the first time,<br />
acknowledges his impending death.</p>

<p>Though she acts within her worlds,<br />
striving to continue<br />
in the only way she knows,<br />
seeking fervently<br />
to return and remain<br />
in familiar terrain,<br />
the forms of her dream<br />
hold not their enticing allure,<br />
and her efforts to remain<br />
in all that she knows<br />
provide no satisfaction.</p>

<p>Her thirst is not fulfilled,<br />
and even her sleep is troubled.</p>

<p>The dreamer,<br />
saddened by the growing loss of luster<br />
beheld in his dreams,<br />
becomes as one who grasps at mirages,<br />
finding naught but emptiness<br />
in his hands,<br />
yet continues to grasp<br />
because it is all he knows to do.</p>

<p>She waits for a death<br />
she is sure will come,<br />
both loathing it<br />
and secretly longing for it.<br />
She is defeated<br />
but knows not how,<br />
nor by what.</p>

<p>The dreams,<br />
that throughout countless lifetimes<br />
had fed him with the promise<br />
of fulfillment,<br />
wither,<br />
like parched leaves clinging to branches<br />
whose source of water<br />
is mysteriously severed from unseen roots,<br />
while the power of his life<br />
drains from his limbs.</p>

<p>The proud dreamer<br />
has not the energy to dream,<br />
and believes beyond question<br />
that where there are not dreams,<br />
there is not Life,<br />
and the growing emptiness<br />
is as a torment to him.</p>

<p>She raises her head only occasionally,<br />
and feebly,<br />
hoping to the end to see in her dreams<br />
the Life she had always sought there.</p>

<p>Finally,<br />
wearied to the bone<br />
of fighting what he senses<br />
but cannot see,<br />
of what he feels<br />
but cannot grasp,<br />
the dreamer releases not only<br />
the last vestige of his will to dream,<br />
but lays down<br />
even the dream of the dreamer,<br />
and dissolves into what he knows<br />
must certainly be<br />
his final, and consummate,<br />
death.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p class="center omit"><em>And the first shall be last,<br />
and the last, first.</em></p>

<p>And now,<br />
the dreamer is laid to rest.</p>

<p>It is a rest<br />
from which there can be<br />
no hope of arising.</p>

<p>Unlike the many pauses<br />
in which the maker of all worlds<br />
merely retreated to gain strength<br />
for his journeys,<br />
this rest<br />
transcends the world.<br />
It transcends the body,<br />
the mind,<br />
and all the dreamer<br />
had thought himself to be.</p>

<p>It is a rest<br />
in which even the soul reclines,<br />
turned away<br />
from all enchantments,<br />
dissolved in the Mystery of all mysteries,<br />
beyond the pale of words,<br />
beyond all imagined things.</p>

<p>Verily,<br />
the dreamer<br />
is no more to be found.<br />
Vanished without a trace,<br />
not only of her ending,<br />
<em>but of her beginning;</em><br />
the journey which <em>seemed</em> to be,<br />
is <em>not</em>.</p>

<p>And the last,<br />
made to be first,<br />
is again become last.</p>

<p>Not by a force which comes<br />
from outside the dreamer,<br />
but a force which already abides<br />
in the very seed<br />
of the dreamer’s beginning;<br />
the certainty of his death<br />
is present in his birth<br />
and must inevitably flower,<br />
its petals blotting out<br />
the very dream of the dreamer itself.</p>

<p>Yet what is perceived<br />
by the dreamer<br />
as the darkness of certain death,<br />
the giving up of all hope for salvation<br />
in the things of the worlds<br />
she has conjured into being,<br />
is not darkness,<br />
but Light.</p>

<p>It is that Light which lights all things,<br />
the echo of an endless song<br />
coming as a thief in the night,<br />
the eternal voice of our Holy Father.</p>

<p>And the Voice<br />
has overcome<br />
the shouting of the world,<br />
restoring the Son<br />
to a rest true and deep,<br />
a rest which alone can heal and transform<br />
the heart of his holy Son.</p>

<p>The one who would be<br />
the dreamer of all worlds rests,<br />
unseen by a world<br />
unaware of what occurs in its midst,<br />
all boundaries<br />
that have defined her form<br />
dissolved in incomprehensible Light.</p>

<p>The Son abides<br />
in the rest of perfect Grace.</p>

<p>What was last<br />
and made first<br />
is again made last.</p>

<p>And all the heavens rejoice<br />
beyond the capacity of the world<br />
to hear.</p>

<p>And now is the world,<br />
entranced by the power of its dreams,<br />
lifted gently toward<br />
the open arms of God.</p>

<p>At the end of a holy instant,<br />
incapable of measurement<br />
by a world imprisoned in time,<br />
the rest of the only begotten<br />
Son of God<br />
gives rise to a movement<br />
not born of a mind<br />
bound to the illusion of separation,<br />
but of the eternal Heart<br />
of the arisen Christ,<br />
a movement that would take him<br />
not back into the dream of the world,<br />
but ever deeper<br />
into the Reality of his being:<br />
a journey <em>within</em> the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>Awakened,<br />
the mind free<br />
from the shackles of want,<br />
the body free<br />
from useless demands<br />
made by a self that never was,<br />
a heart beating only<br />
by the breath of the Most High,<br />
the arisen Christ moves<br />
where once the world arose,<br />
seeing naught but the glory<br />
of his Father’s Kingdom:<br />
radiance beyond description,<br />
joy without boundary,<br />
purpose in which<br />
fulfillment is certain.</p>

<p>Here,<br />
no trace of effort<br />
is to be found.</p>

<p>Here,<br />
no taint of striving<br />
clouds his perception.</p>

<p>Here,<br />
no constriction of the heart<br />
by the grand illusion of fear<br />
is felt.</p>

<p>Reduced to simplicity,<br />
exalted above all things,<br />
the one transformed<br />
by the miracle of Grace<br />
lives and walks.<br />
Behold!<br />
The dreamer,<br />
now transformed,<br />
is reborn as the one<br />
through whom the Father alone<br />
works to transfigure the world.</p>

<p>For darkness shall become as Light,<br />
extended without end<br />
until Creation itself is no more.</p>

<p>Indeed,<br />
the first is again, first.</p>

<p>As it was in the beginning,<br />
is now,<br />
and forever shall be.</p>

<p>The Prodigal Son<br />
is returned,<br />
and all of Heaven is shaken<br />
by the praise of the Heavenly Host;<br />
the Father and the Son<br />
rest together as one<br />
in that peace which forever passes<br />
all understanding.</p>

<p>To any among you<br />
who has ears to hear,<br />
<em>let her hear</em>.</p>

<p>And all things <em>are</em> made new.</p>
