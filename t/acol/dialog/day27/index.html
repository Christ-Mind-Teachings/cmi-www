    <p>27.1 Think now not of being apprehensive in terms of being fearful of
the rest of your life, but apprehensive in terms of taking hold of the
rest of your life, of keeping it within your understanding, within your
ability to come to know, within your own grasp of it. You have been
asked to let go of much, but not of life.</p>

<p>27.2 You have been asked to let go of uncertainty, not certainty. You
have been assured of a certainty you never before believed you were
capable of. This certainty is beginning to form within you but will not
come into its fullness except through experience. This certainty has
only been able to begin to form within you because you have agreed to
this mountain top experience while remaining engaged in life. You have
thus begun to experience on two levels. This has been a goal of the time
we have spent together in this way.</p>

<p>27.3 Experiencing life without the insight of spirit was to experience
external life. Life itself showed you the way, pointed you in differing
directions, taught you what you needed to know. This was the external
experience of life. Most of you have had well-examined external lives.
You have looked for causes behind the direction in which life led you,
but your life was not inner-directed because it was devoid of
inner-sight. While you looked outwardly for signposts to guide you, the
self-guidance of inner-sight was not developed.</p>

<p>27.4 Inner-sight made an appearance on occasion, showing up as flashes
of insight. These flashes of insight might be thought of as brief views
from the mountain. The obstacles confronted on level ground suddenly
gave way and you saw clearly, if only for an instant. You saw as if from
a great distance, and because of that great distance, your view was
expanded.</p>

<p>27.5 This is the quality of the inner-sight you now will carry with you
to level ground because you have practiced during our mountain top time
together the ability to experience on two levels.</p>

<p>27.6 Coming to know is not an aspect of the mind alone. It is not an
aspect of the spirit alone. Coming to know is a quality of inner-sight,
of wholehearted human experience combined with spiritual experience. You
are and always have been both human and spirit, both form and content.
Now you contain within you the ability to combine both levels of being
through the experience of life. You have already been doing this. You
are, in fact, becoming well-practiced.</p>

<p>27.7 Now you are asked to apprehend—to understand, and to hold within
your conscious mind—this situation that you find yourself in, this new
relationship that you have with yourself and with life. You quite
literally have a new way of seeing. You might think of this initially as
having two perspectives, an internal and an external perspective, a
human perspective and a spiritual perspective, a perspective from level
ground and a mountain top perspective. Your descent from the mountain
top will not mean that you no longer have the perspective gained there.
You did not “go” to the mountain. The mountain came to you.</p>

<p>27.8 As you continue to practice your apprehension of this new
situation, it will become more than a concept. As was spoken of in A
Treatise on the Nature of Unity and Its Recognition, it will become a
trusted ability and, through practice, lose its dualistic seeming nature
and become as intrinsic to who you are as is breathing. In this same
way, the dualistic seeming nature of all of life will be revealed to
only seem to be so.</p>

<p>27.9 The two levels of experience which you have been participating in
are the joint cornerstones for the biggest revelations yet. All that is
now seen as dualistic in nature can be experienced as different levels
of experience of one whole. You might consider this by again picturing
the mountain-top. Looking in one direction, you might see only darkness.
Looking in another, you might see the dawning of light. Opposites exist
only as different aspects of one whole. Different aspects exist only as
different levels of experience.</p>

<p>27.10 To be able to hold onto, apprehend, and carry with you the ability
to experience both levels of experience, the internal and the external,
the form and the content, the human and the divine, is to elevate the
self of form, or, in other words, to be what you have always been:
Whole.</p>

<p>27.11 As darkness and light, hot and cold, sickness and health are each
just opposite ends of the same continuum, you can now see that they are
only distinguished by degrees of separation. So too have you been.</p>

<p>27.12 The degree of your separation from wholeness can be seen much as
the degree of separation between hot and cold. If you were to perceive
of wholeness as an ideal temperature, you might think for a moment, just
as an illustration, of your experience of separation always taking place
at a certain number of degrees away from the ideal. The “temperature”
was thus never perfect, but rather always either too hot or too cold.
Yet the perfect temperature always existed, you just did not experience
it. You were, in other words, separate from it because of the degree of
separation that you chose. Because you never chose union, or wholeness,
you did not experience lack of body temperature or the effects of
weather, but it is as if you denied your body the ideal 98.6 degrees
internally and 78 degrees externally. There is no living body that does
not exhibit a temperature, no environment that does not do so. Some kind
of temperature is thus a constant. A constant is an aspect of wholeness.
A variable is an aspect of separation. The constant does not become
variable because variability exists.</p>

<p>27.13 That you are who you are and that you have always been the
accomplished is a constant and an aspect of wholeness. The variability
of how you experience who you are is also a constant within the aspect
of separation. Merge the two, however, into one level of experience and
the whole formula changes.</p>

<p>27.14 This is what we move toward as we practice participating in two
levels of experience simultaneously. We practice experiencing the
constant and the variable as one. We practice experiencing the constant
and the variable together. We practice in order to move toward an
experience of variability within wholeness rather than within
separation. It can be done.</p>

<p>27.15 Life, your humanity, is the variability. Spirit, your oneness, is
the constant. Life is oneness extended into separation and variability
through experience. The elevated Self of form will be the expression of
new life lived within the constant of wholeness but continuing to
experience the variability of separation. This is what you practice as
you gather on the mountain top while remaining on level ground.</p>

<p>27.16 Separation, as well as the variability of the experience of the
separate self, have always been variables that exist within the constant
of wholeness. What you have experienced, however, has not been wholeness
or the experience of wholeness, but the experience of separation. What
we are speaking of now is being able to experience wholeness and the
variability of experience that has come through the separated self of
form. This is what you are beginning to do through your practice. Your
proficiency will change your experience, and your experience will change
the world.</p>
