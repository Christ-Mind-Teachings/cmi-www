    <p>Now we begin.</p>

<p>Indeed, greetings unto you once again, holy and only begotten Son of
God, begotten, not made, and eternally of one substance with all that
the Father is — <em>begotten before time and of one substance with all
that the Father is</em>. Need we say anything else?</p>

<p><em>Begotten, not born, but begotten before time is.</em> Hmm. And all of you
have been led to believe that the body in which you believe yourself to
be living came forth but a few short years ago, and you with it. That is
an illusion.</p>

<p><em>Begotten before time is.</em> Your home is eternity. Your being is the Love
of God. Nothing has ever changed it; nothing has ever tainted it;
nothing has ever limited it except your choice to use your infinite
wisdom and power and creativity to create the illusion of limitation.
And with it came the birth of time.</p>

<p><em>Begotten before time is</em>. Have you ever wondered what that must surely
mean? For if those words be used as a description for me, Jeshua, the
Christ, they can mean nothing in relationship to me if they do not
already mean <em>the same</em> in relationship to you. Now, how can that be?
For well have you been taught that I am something special and you a
simple creature. And yet, in reality — not in illusion but in
reality — you and I are One, and all that has ever been said about me is
<em>about you</em>. Every flowery word written in your Holy Scripture is <em>about
you</em>. Every word that would denigrate you and say that you are a simple
creature is not about you at all; it is about somebody else’s illusions.</p>

<p>For well have I spoken unto you that you are loved wholly and you have
never sinned. You are the Light and the Life of mankind, and wherever
you are, the fullness of God comes to be expressed and to be extended
unto the one who stands in front of you, and the only thing that can
ever create a barrier between you and your brother is <em>your</em> choice to
believe that you are other than what God created you to be. Therefore,
that veil that you would create is only your choice to use the infinite
power extended unto you to create a very flimsy screen called
separation. In it there is no power. In it there is no reality. In it
there is nothing of Truth.</p>

<p>From my perspective — which is the one you are choosing to recognize and
reawaken to—that illusion does <em>not exist</em>. And when you choose to see
your brother through the very eyes that I see you, you will look with
the eyes of Christ and you will know and understand that you are born
into this world to be the saviour of this world.</p>

<p>Therefore, birth can only take place in time. Birth is taking that which
is eternal and changeless and coming down to express in a form that the
world can understand — the birthing of a saviour. The Christmas story is
yours, the Easter story is yours, whenever you choose to claim the one
Truth given you before time is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I and my Father are one. I am Christ eternal. I live; yet not I but
Christ lives in me and through me. Though of myself I can do nothing,
my Father through me does all things because He is the Light and the
Life and the Way and the Truth, and I am one with Him eternally.</em></p>

  <p><em>The world can give me nothing and the world can take nothing from me.
Therefore, I live not in fear. I live not in lack and I live not in
want. But I live to extend and to share with my holy brother and
sister the fullness of my being, and when I do that, I ignite in them
the possibility of claiming that reality as their very own.</em></p>

  <p><em>And whenever I choose to come together with my brother and sister and
tolerating not a trace of error in me or in them, and they choose to
see me through that very same Light, the two have become again as one.
Sacred intimacy is realized and the Atonement is completed on Earth as
it is already in Heaven.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the power given unto you. It is the power given unto me. It is
by that power that I come and blend with this carcass that you think is
owned by my beloved brother. And I come forth and I use this vehicle to
do nothing else than to make manifest <em>who you are</em>, and I will come
again and again to serve as your mirror until when you look at even this
carcass and hear these words, you recognize that you are looking on no
one but yourself, and you are hearing your own voice, that voice that
was given you of our Father <em>before time is</em>.</p>

<p>When you claim those words as your own, then all power is unleashed on
Earth in this bodily temple as it is already in Heaven. You think that
you are separate from this carcass and I tell you that you are not. If
you were to break down your perception and stop looking at the color of
your hair and the width and girth of the physical forms, and start to
look at what your scientists call molecules and atoms and quarks and
electrons and little quantas of light, you would discover that there is
not one trace of difference between the body you <em>think</em> is yours and
this carcass that you <em>think</em> belongs to my beloved brother — not one
trace of difference.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the perception that bodies abide in space and time and are
separate from one another is itself an illusion. And yet, you have the
power to see with eyes that are crystal clear, having let go of every
trace of illusion of separation, to see not with the eyes of the body
but with the eyes of the arisen Christ, to see not a body in front of
you but to see the thought of Perfect Love in form that is your brother
and your sister. And what power, what healing could you extend unto
another if you saw not the body in separation, but if you saw <em>the
eternal presence of Christ</em> in the one before you? Now, it doesn’t
really matter if they’ve forgotten. What matters is that <em>you</em> remember.</p>

<p>Hmm. That is why, when in Truth you have awakened and chosen never again
to tolerate error in your own perception, when you stand in bodily form
in front of another and look into their eyes with the Light of Christ,
your simple smile can heal lifetimes. And to the degree that they are
willing to receive that Light of the Christ you are, even before your
eyes miracles can occur.</p>

<p>Can you come to understand then, that if you are not seeing miracles in
<em>your</em> life, it is because you are still choosing to linger in a little
trace of darkness that says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I believe in God. I believe in Christ, but I am not really quite that
Light. If I work a little harder and perfect it, the next time around
I will be.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most arrogant of acts is to insist that you are <em>other</em> than Christ
Your world would teach you just the opposite, would it not? For indeed,
to say, “I am the arisen Christ,” is beheld as the ultimate act of being
arrogant.</p>

<p>I tried it and they tried to crucify me. Do you fear crucifixion? Many
of you know that what I just said speaks directly to your heart, for you
struggle in this world and you run up against your fear and you don’t
understand its source.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Why do I still live in lack? Why do I not manifest the power of
Christ?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I say unto you: it is because you still carry that trace of fear
that the world will crucify you if you truly live in your power. And
what is power but the <em>choice</em> to rest in the gentleness of allowing
your only reality to be lived with every breath you breathe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Will the world crucify me if I let go of every trace of belief that I
have ever been separate from God, if I leap off the cliff and trust
the power of God to live through me, to throw off my shackles of lack
and want and fear? And to let Christ live in me so that I can shout
with one of my ancient brothers: I live; yet not I but Christ lives in
me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if the world would look upon you and say, “There’s goes another
nut,” can you understand that what you are hearing is coming from a
voice of illusion in which <em>no power resides</em>? And if that is
true — and I assure you that it is — who cares about the opinions of
another mind who would insist on illusions over reality?</p>

<p>Many of you know what it means to want to wake up every morning and see
your world at peace, to see the complexities of the world healed, to see
the chaos ceased, the insanity dissolved. And yet, you arise in the
morning and you go out and conform yourself to those very opinions
because you still believe that the world can keep you safe, and by
conforming to it, you can escape crucifixion.</p>

<p>And yet I say unto you: conformity to the perceptions of your world <em>is</em>
to choose crucifixion. And as I came forth once before, I come now yet
again into this world in many ways. And even in this hour in this
evening I am communicating through similar forms in over a hundred
locations upon your planet to do one thing: to beseech you to join me,
<em>not in the Crucifixion but in the Resurrection</em>. There is a Light and a
power that is coming to be born upon this plane that is arising from the
very soils of this, your Holy Mother, and the time is short upon this
Earth. And I ask you to arise with me <em>to be the Resurrection</em>.</p>

<p>You know how to be the crucifixion. You have played that one out very
well, and all of the gods and all of the levels of this universe applaud
you on your ability to put on such a drama. Hm. But the curtain is being
raised now. Many in this room are sensitive to the raising of that
curtain. You feel it as a quickening that begins to move energy up and
down the spine. It creates a feeling at times: “Oh, my God, what’s going
to happen next?” Open up and let it happen, because the raising of the
curtain is nothing more than the death of illusion: because Light is
being born because it is being remembered.</p>

<p>Therefore, would you join me and be part of the solution instead of part
of the continuation of the problem?</p>

<p>Understand well, fatigue has <em>nothing at all</em> to do with the body. It
has <em>everything</em> to do with the mind. <em>It has everything to do with the
mind</em>. And when the mind is awakened and chooses only Light and
tolerates never again error in its own perceptions and gives every
moment over to the Holy Spirit, then indeed, that mind is enlightened
because the heart is awakened, and the body will leap up like a bunch of
little soldiers that have been sleeping on guard duty and say, “Oh, my
God, there’s been a change here,” and the cells become active. And they
begin to realize that you are going to send the infinite Light of God to
them and therefore they have to relearn their job. No longer will they
be able to tolerate extending sickness to you because you have been
sending sick thoughts to them. Do you understand what I am saying? The
body is your perfect servant and if you know depression or disease, it
is because over a long period of time you’ve trained the cells of your
body to conform to the dis-eased perception held in the mind. And when
you have healed that perception, the body must follow suit.</p>

<p>And it is very possible — and you are going to see it happen upon this
plane; many of you are going to live to see this happen in these
bodies — that when there is a moment’s disease or sickness in the body,
that very mind will simply choose Light, will transfer Light from the
infinitude of Heaven and express it on Earth, and the very cells of the
body will instantly be healed. That is what a master can do, and you
have come not to be slaves to the world but to demonstrate mastery in
<em>all</em> regards. And mastery requires utmost responsibility: the ability
to respond, and to look upon the whole of this world and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My goodness, I am the one that made this and now I am going to undo
it. Where am I going to start? Right where I am.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If all minds are joined — and I assure you that they are — right where
you, are even in this moment were you to throw open the shackles off of
the heart and mind, to open the cells of the body and to say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am the Holy Son of God and I claim my Kingdom. Let Light descend to
Earth now, in me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>… to do that is to have already uplifted the whole of creation.</p>

<p>Imagine that in my Father’s house there are many mansions. Each room is
a heart and mind, and this mansion has an infinite number of rooms. And
you are living in a tiny little closet on the first floor. And you know
that above you there are thousands and thousands of floors, and when you
open the door of your tiny closet and peek down the l-o-n-g corridor,
you know that there are thousands and thousands of rooms on the very
floor you are on, and your Father has just said unto you, “I want you to
sweep the dust out of the corners of every room.” Hmm.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oh, my God, what a task. Whew! How will I ever get it accomplished?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The secret to the rebirthing of the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth is for
<em>you</em> to realize that when you sweep the dust out of the corners of
<em>your own tiny closet</em>, you have done it in <em>every room</em> in my Father’s
mansion, because all minds and hearts are joined. Therefore, receive
that healing for yourself and you <em>are</em> the janitor that has cleaned
every room in the mansion. Makes it much easier.</p>

<p>Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>While time continues for yet a little while, it is given unto you to
make that choice with every breath. This is what I mean by
response-ability: the ability to respond in each moment,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What thought am I choosing to hold? Am I conforming myself to
limitation and lack and fear? Or am I choosing to be the fullness of
the Kingdom now because I am begotten before all worlds and am of one
substance eternally with all that my Father is?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the choice to be made. That is the choice that is <em>so important</em>
upon this plane in this time.</p>

<p>In this room this evening there are many, many, many beings who do not
at this point associate with physical bodies as you do. They are all
around you. Some of you have been feeling that already. Some of you
noticed and had thoughts come even while you were whirling around
talking and eating,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>There’s something about this room tonight. What is it?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could say other guests have been arriving for a while, to help do
some things with the energy here. I have said unto you that I am one who
likes to have a lot of friends, and this isn’t the only plane that I
like to have friends on; and this is not the only plane that is
available to <em>you</em>. Each of you has what you know as guides and teachers
and friends on planes unseen with the physical eyes, and <em>they are there
for you because they love you</em>. They know that you are Christ eternal
and they will do anything they can to help you remember, to help you
unlock that power to bring the fullness of the Kingdom and express it in
<em>this</em> world.</p>

<p>Fear not crucifixion. All of you have tasted the illusion of death. Not
one of you has escaped being persecuted by others in this drama, and you
all carry that fear of crucifixion. Call it rejection. Call it abuse.
Call it being put to death. Whatever form it comes, there is a fear that
keeps your heart contracted. And yet, the fear itself is an illusion.</p>

<p>That illusion is paper thin, so thin that it only takes one choice to
walk through it. And I ask you to join with me, precious and holy and
ancient friends, begotten before all worlds, you who are of one
substance with all that I am, <em>I ask you to walk through</em> <em>that veil
within yourself and to never settle again for anything but the Power and
the Wisdom and the Truth of the Kingdom to be uttered by your lips, to
be extended by the movements of your body, that only Light lives in you
and as you</em> — and you will be the Light that heals this world.</p>

<p>The body is nothing more than a tool of communication. And it’s not even
yours! So what are you worried about? Nobody is going to nail it to a
cross this time; and even if they did, it wouldn’t matter. From dust the
body is created and to dust the body shall return. It is the gift of
your Holy Mother, given unto Christ eternal to become as a vehicle for
communicating the unconditional Love of God.</p>

<p>If only you could understand what’s really occurring on this Earth.
Reality is not outside of you. It is not in the complexities that have
been brought forth into this world. Reality is <em>in</em> you, and all that
you have seen and all of the dramas unfolded in this world have been
nothing more than you walking into a certain movie house and watching a
certain movie. And now the time upon this plane is for you to arise from
that seat, to go back out to the center of the movie house that has many
little theaters in it, to go back to the center of your heart and to
remember who you are, and then to walk into a different theater in which
a new movie is about to start — a movie of Light, of abundance, of joy,
of peace, of <em>extraordinary miracles</em>. The movie has already started and
I come to be your usher to say, “Quickly, quickly, come with me. Tarry
no longer. The old movie is already over.” You are just sitting in the
chair running it through your mind, all of the horrible scenes, and yet
the film has already stopped.</p>

<p>Wait for me. I’ve got to get the popcorn.</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>For that, we will hold all things up. Indeed. How are you doing, my
brother?</p>

<p>Very well, thank you.</p>

<p>Gone through a few changes in the last few weeks?</p>

<p>Uh huh.</p>

<p><em>Hold nothing back!</em> The river is starting to flow in a way that you
could not have understood even a few short months ago. Open yourself up
wholly every day and tell the Holy Spirit you are ready. Dare your
Father to let the fullness of the union of Father and Son to explode
through you. Just dare Him to see if He can overwhelm you. Do it every
day when you arise. It is very important now because the habits you have
known will want to creep back to build little dams. Choose the power of
that Light. Choose it with everything you have got every morning when
you arise and give thanks for it every night before you sleep.</p>

<p>Fair enough?</p>

<p>Quite.</p>

<p>Quite a small price to pay for the Grace that heals a hundred thousand
illusions.</p>

<p>I thought it was just one.</p>

<p>One and a hundred thousand are simply two ways to say the same thing.</p>

<p>Well then, how are we all doing? It was a bit of a long greeting. I am
sorry.</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>It was worth it. It was nice. Wonderful.</p>

<p>You answered my questions.</p>

<p>Ah. What are you going to do with the answers?</p>

<p>Oh. That is a trick question. Yeah, that is a trick question. Rejoice in
them. Take them. Well, you just said about the old habits wanting to
jump out of their little corners and grab us again. That really holds
true, and it has for me in the last week and I hope it’s the last
hurrah.</p>

<p>You hope?</p>

<p>Oh, okay. Got me.</p>

<p>No, I just gently corrected you.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Beloved brother, it is <em>you</em> that has <em>me</em>, and I abide in your heart as
the fullness of your being. And the fullness of that being creates the
experience of Jeshua so that you can talk with your true Self.
Understand well what I am saying unto you because this relates for all
of you: inasmuch as you have been as one mind as the ego, or the
separate self sense that has created all worlds, you are already of one
Mind and one Heart in creating the salvation of the Sonship. As you have
created the dramas of illusions of separation, so, too, do you create
the drama of salvation.</p>

<p>Therefore, all that I am — and I have said this to you before — as
Jeshua Joseph ben Joseph, who came and walked and talked, who sweated,
got hungry, urinated in the woods  ( I’m sorry they didn’t put that part
in the Bible ),  all of the things you have ever done and felt tempted
by, I, too, have tasted. And yet, understand that <em>my life is wholly</em>
<em>yours</em>. You are the ones who brought forth the life of Jeshua Joseph
ben Joseph, to be the saviour of the world, a mirror that you could look
in and be reminded of the Truth of yourself. You could say that you
decided to sleep and have a very nice drama, and you scripted that there
would be a being upon this plane and when you looked at him, it would
trigger a remembrance like,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Ah, the bell has rung. Time for me to wake up from my drama. It’s
been nice but there is a far greater one to be lived.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are all that I am and between us there is not anything called
separation.</p>

<p>Therefore, beloved brother, do not hope that it will be their last
hurrah, but <em>decree</em> that that is true. Hm!</p>

<p>I would give you a little assignment. Are you ready?</p>

<p>I am ready.</p>

<p>We will see. Have I not spoken unto you that in each of your days, do
something a little outrageous? Anyone hear that before?</p>

<p>Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>How long has it been since you put it into practice?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, I think once last week I finally had the time to do something
outrageous.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Precious friend, go unto one of your malls, stand on one of the seats
there. They usually put them around those plastic flowers. There’s
nothing like the aroma of plastic flowers.</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>Stand upon the step there or the seat and decree at the top of your
lungs,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am the holy Son of God, and in this moment I decree that all of my
illusions have just had their last hurrah.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And look around at those who look at you with their chin on the floor
and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Isn’t it great that we are One?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then just go about your business.</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>Now [breathes deeply]…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Holy Father, let these be in me even as I am in You. Let them see the
Truth of their being, for I have served them since before the
beginning of time and that time is at hand. Father, enter their hearts
that they might hear this simple Gospel and see that the time is at
hand.</em></p>

  <p><em>Long have I toiled for You. Long have I served the Atonement of Your
only begotten Son. And I beseech You, Father, enter these as You have
entered me, with the fullness of Your Light and Your Glory and Your
Wisdom and Your Power and Your Love. Let them be in me as I am in You,
that together the Son might be one again with the Father to express
the joy of that perfect union, to blend with the energies of this, our
Holy Mother, and to express through these bodies the one Truth of Life
eternal.</em></p>

  <p><em>Father, I beseech You, let the time be now and let them awaken to the
Truth of our union. Let illusions be ended. Father, let Illusions be
ended.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would you not receive my prayer? Would you not throw open the shutters
of your heart, for I stand and knock, and I beseech you, precious ones
whom I love deeply, the time is at hand to put down illusions and join
me in the Resurrection.</p>

<p>Very soon now, Easter is upon you. What is it going to mean to you this
year? Will it mean what the world wants you to believe it means? That
someone in your long, past history finally got the message? Or worse
yet, that one was sent by God and was without sin and was perfect
anyway. That puts me on a pedestal so far above you that my lifetime
becomes totally meaningless. For if I came not and dwell among you as a
man, tempted to live the Crucifixion, then my Resurrection is totally
meaningless. Look not then upon me with the eyes the world has given
you. But please look with the eyes that I seek to give you: to see that
I am your brother and your friend. And if Jeshua can awaken to the Truth
of his being, then, Lord knows, so can you, <em>because you are already
my equal</em>.</p>

<p>So, would you join me in a little exercise — rather, a little
celebration? Those of you who in this moment feel that your shoulders
are a little hunched, throw them back. For God’s sake, what are you
trying to protect yourself from? What burdens are you insisting on
carrying?</p>

<p>I feel guilty.</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>So release the guilt and throw the shoulders back. Feel a lightness come
to the spine itself. It is the tree of life. Let its branches reach up
to the Light of the Father. In the depth of your being, now you can
throw open the doorway to each and every cell of the body, your perfect
servants.</p>

<p>Block not the angel of air, but feel it ascending and descending along
the tree of life. Breathe not only the angel of air but l<em>et each breath
be a breath of Light and of power, and of wisdom and of joy</em>. Within
yourself say unto your Father,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Yes, I receive You.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throw open your heart. Receive it. Dare your Father to send you so much
Light that it feels the body might explode. Open yourselves. <em>Come to
where I am</em>.</p>

<p>Let that little vibration begin. Feel the quickening within you. With
every inbreath say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Yes, I accept my Truth. I am the Son of God. I am the Light of the
world. I and my Father are One. I and my Father are One. I and my
Father are One!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of you are beginning to see certain colors. Let them come more
brightly, more vibrantly. Receive them. Feel the cells all the way down
to your fingertips and toes opening. If you begin to feel a little
lightheaded and giddy, all the much better. Seriousness has no place in
the Kingdom.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Yes, I am the Light of the world. I am the birthing of the New
Age that is upon this earth. I am all power and I am all Light and I
am all joy. I live; yet not I but Christ lives in me, for I am that
Mind and that Heart.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you be that power — and I assure you that you are — let not
timidity come upon you again. And now, all together, we’re going to take
one very deep breath, and we are going to inhale the Light and the power
of God, and as we exhale, we are going to open our mouths and let sound
come out. Take a nice deep inbreath and with all the power of the Christ
we are…</p>

<p>[Loud toning, continuing for a while.]</p>

<p>Not bad. How are you feeling?</p>

<p>Good. Great. Very good. Energized.</p>

<p>Vibrations of yourselves.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Why would you settle for anything less in any moment of your day?</p>

<p>So, you see, when next you are in one of your board meetings and you
feel the energy of the world wanting to contract you down so that you
are conformed to everybody’s illusion of lack and suffering, now you
know what to do to change it.</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>Yes. All right. Corporate management will fall down.</p>

<p>It’s about time it fell down.</p>

<p>Don’t you understand what it’s all about? To <em>be</em> the Light of the
world, not to pray that Light will come. You have been doing that for
thousands of lifetimes. Receive the simplicity of the Gospel. If Light
is to come, <em>you</em> are the ones that have to bring it. Gone is the time
of timidity. Gone the time of weakness and lack and frailty. How can you
abide in those states and still expect the new world to be born? How can
you translate the unhappy dream of the chaos of this world into the
happiness of the rebirthing of the Kingdom unless you choose to be that?
Not to seek it, not to pray for it, but to decree that the time is at
hand because <em>you</em> are choosing that <em>now is the</em> <em>time</em>.</p>

<p>What do you think, Seedplanter?</p>

<p>I agree. It’s the time. Feels good.</p>

<p>You have a certain song, <em>The times, they are a-changing</em>. Are <em>you</em>
going to change with them? Because, indeed, the time comes rather
quickly now that if you choose not to, shall we say, uplift the
frequency of your being by declaring that you will never again tolerate
the error of misperception that you are anything other than the
embodiment of joy, if you choose not to do that, you are simply not
going to be able to be on your beloved Earth any longer — because the
very heat of joy that will be coming from the very soil, the body of
your Holy Mother, will be something that you can’t tolerate because you
are choosing a heavy vibration that can no longer abide on this Earth.</p>

<p>There are going to be a few that make that choice, to insist on the
heaviness. And what will happen when the energy of the Earth becomes so
transparent that solid things cannot abide upon it and they simply sink
through it? Now, that’s a metaphor, of course, but it means that if you
truly love your Holy Mother, you had better get it in gear and catch up
with the changes going on in Her own frequencies.</p>

<p>Don’t let the heart contract with fear; you cannot experience death. All
you can ever experience is the consequence of your choice. All of you
understand well that what you experience in your life is the <em>effect</em> of
your <em>choice</em>. And a new choice is being born upon this plane, a choice
that will tolerate <em>only</em> Light, <em>only</em> peace, <em>only</em> joy, <em>only</em>
abundance, <em>only</em> service one unto another. The time is going to come
upon this plane when minds and bodies can’t sit still because they are
going to be running around the whole time, finding a way to extend
service and love to their brothers and sisters, and nothing but service.
Gone will be the energy of taking, and it will be replaced by the energy
of giving, because being rebirthed is the simple Truth that as you give,
you receive.</p>

<p>Give your love away and you will never be without it. Give your vision
of One Heart and One Mind away and you will experience it growing within
you by leaps and bounds, and you will attract unto yourself other minds
and hearts that have been waiting for you to give them the signal to
live as unlimited vision. For it is through vision that your Father
extends His Love and Creativity into this world. And where there is not
vision, what happens to the people? They perish.</p>

<p>All of you know what it means to perish. Some of you are still insisting
on perishing. Some of you are yet insisting that lack must be your
experience. It’s just a chronic habit. Let it go. Insist on abundance.
Live abundantly. Live from the Truth that you know there is no such
thing as lack. You are here to serve, expressing the unconditional Love
of God — and do you think that if your Father is going to ask you to go
forth and teach all nations, that He is going to leave you in poverty?
Tell Him to get off His can and make sure you have everything you need
for the fulfillment of your mission.</p>

<p>Jeshua, why do you say that? Because there is a reason behind that?</p>

<p>What? A reason behind what I say? Oh! Now I have to think up one.</p>

<p>Well, those words… you know, that were said that way.</p>

<p>Firewalker, look at the subtleties of your own thought. You are
beginning to catch some of the fire you’ve been walking on. When you
say, “I pray for a new world order to be manifested on this Earth,” but
you, yourself, choose to live in the impoverishment of a lack of energy,
a lack of golden coins, in the belief that there is nothing you can do
to change your <em>own</em> status, you have basically depleted the very life
force that is required for the birthing of that new world order. <em>You</em>
have to be an <em>example</em> of that new world order.</p>

<p>Therefore, when you pray unto your Father,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Help me, Father, to do your will, whatever it is,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>you come from a place of weakness and lack. That is why I have said that
the time of false piety is over with. It is time for you to rise and to
stand on the little seats in your malls and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Father, I have come here to serve the Atonement of Your Son. Now, get
off your can and don’t forget what we are doing here.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>Ohhh.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Give me the abundance of Your Kingdom because I need it to do Your
work. Bring it to me. And, by the way, I happen to like nice clothes,
and I am not going to drive a rattletrap to do Your work.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, God.</p>

<p>The reality you experience is nothing more than the expression of the
frequency and the vibration you insist on holding on to. Upgrade your
vibrations and frequency daily and the world around you will have to
change its shape.</p>

<p>I am calling you not to be meek any longer, but meek in the <em>true</em>
sense. So meek and so pure that there is not one trace of illusion to be
found in you. Allow the death of the world to take place in your own
consciousness, that the Kingdom can be reborn in it.</p>

<p>Some of you believe that to achieve great abundance is going to take a
lifetime of straining and planning and hard work because it’s a tough
world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’m going to have to compete. And if I’m really lucky, in twenty
years I’ll be able to retire and pay my bills.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That thinking does not exist in the Kingdom. The only thinking that
exists in the Kingdom is that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am the Holy Son of God and all of the abundance of my Father is
given to me now. And I live from it, and I extend it, and I give it
away freely and gladly to anyone who would ask. And if my brother
lives in lack, I will teach him how to live in abundance because I
can’t tolerate this any longer.</em></p>

  <p><em>I am the holy Son of God and I am going to bring the whole of
creation with me, and I am not going to stop until it comes to where I
am. I am Christ eternal. And even as I manifested Jeshua Joseph ben
Joseph and demonstrated the Truth of the Kingdom, I choose now to be
the fullness of who I am, and I am going to manifest nothing but
miracles until all of my brothers and sisters wake up with me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm. Do you see the difference?</p>

<p>Jeshua, when you talk about abundance, you mostly mention material
things. The abundance of love…</p>

<p>I have felt a lot of resistance in this community to enacting that. I
wonder if you could speak to the higher vision of how we can go about
creating trust, safety, for us to do that?</p>

<p>Beloved friend, everything that I have spoken unto you this night
addresses that very question. Put it into practice. If there is anyone
with whom you are feeling some variance or enmity, then get on the phone
and call them and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>We’ve got to get together. You see, the time is at hand. Let’s make
sure all of the hatchets are buried. Let’s join together and look into
each other’s eyes and declare that we are the holy Son of God, and we
are going to get on with it and manifest that abundance to make this
community happen because we cannot any longer tolerate error. We
cannot tolerate waiting on the Lord, because we are the Lord.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can you manifest that community of trust and safety? By declaring to
everyone who is attracted to that community that <em>you are giving it to
them</em> and you wholly expect that it will be given to <em>you</em> because
nothing less can any longer be tolerated. Now don’t forget to sing and
dance and play as you are doing that.</p>

<p>The time is at hand, precious friend. The Father indeed provides all
things, and if you would look around you, He is extending unto you many
vehicles and many ways in which you can enact the Truth of who you are
and bring the abundance to you. But it will <em>never</em> happen until <em>you
are ready to declare for yourself the Truth of who you are and</em> <em>to live
it with every breath and to settle for nothing less</em>. Stop waiting for
the person to your right or to your left to make it happen for you.</p>

<p>Beloved friend, that is how. How can you create that safety? By
declaring and demonstrating and <em>being</em> that safety. By <em>being</em> that
Love that embraces all things. By in your own life cleaning out the
cobwebs in your closet, letting the Father manifest all power and wisdom
and abundance through you so that you can show your brother and sister
how to do it also. This is no fun if you do it alone.</p>

<p>The time is at hand, even as many of you have felt a shift in the way I
bring my energy forth to bear through this temporary carcass, and indeed
a shift in what I am not so much saying unto you but the way I am saying
it. Understand that there is a shift in frequency that has gone on in
your Holy Mother, this Earth. Some of you have felt it. Some of you
haven’t noticed at all because you are too busy keeping yourself limited
by the constrictions of your very narrow-minded perceptions. In other
words, you are too wrapped up in the drama of the ego to notice what’s
happening. And those of you that persist in that are going to wake up
one day and realize you are not even on the Earth anymore. You are
somewhere else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What happened? Did the New Age pass me by?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>But you get to come back, don’t you? Choose again to come back?</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>Well, you do. You never get left out. It’s just a matter of when. I
don’t know if I am using that as an excuse or anything, but I’m just
wanting to say that we are all going home. We are all going to make it.
I’m not trying to negate anything you’re saying.</p>

<p>Firewalker, you <em>are</em> trying to negate something that came out of an
impulse of your</p>

<p>own thinking that wants still to have a trapdoor to escape through. If
we are all coming home, that means that for you — this is not at the
conscious mind, it is at a slightly deeper level — you are hoping that
you will still have time to make up for it if you don’t choose it now.
That is where those statements came from.</p>

<p>The mind and heart that chooses the Truth of the Kingdom does not even
entertain the thought that maybe later the choice can still be made
anew. It is too busy choosing <em>now</em>. Contemplate that well within
yourself. For though you would look around you and want many to catch on
fire and leap ahead, there is still a part of you that has the rope tied
around the end of the dock, and your own ship is not quite yet sailing
freely.</p>

<p>That’s true.</p>

<p>I know.</p>

<p>I have news for you. None of this is going to happen until you choose it
for yourself. The whole of creation is <em>on hold, waiting for you</em>. Now,
that’s responsibility! But guess what? The whole of creation is on hold
waiting for <em>each and every one of you</em>. <em>That</em> is your responsibility:
to be the Light of the world with every breath you breathe. You don’t
have time for the drama of separation. You don’t have time for the drama
of indulging in the whimperings of the ego. All of that is an illusion.
You don’t have time for it.</p>

<p>Will you not join with me and truly come to where I am? Come to that
frequency or that vibration that cannot tolerate error in your own
perceptions any longer, to see that there is but One Mind and One Heart,
called Christ, and all of these little bodies are nothing more than
vehicles through which that One Mind and One Heart can express the Love
of God.</p>

<p>Wherever you are, whether you are in a grocery store, and someone else
in this room tonight is in an office, and somebody else in this room
tonight is in a garden planting seeds, can you remember fully that you
are One and you are united and you are together all the time? You are
never alone. You can’t be alone.</p>

<p>And if all you did was to think on the energy in this room and the
little exercise we did and allowed that power to come forth through you,
wherever you are you would know that the power of the one Mind of Christ
is moving through you. And when you extend love unto anyone on this
plane, once it is done, you could just that fast, [snapping fingers]
move to that plane of reality in which everyone in this room is abiding
as if you were sitting around a table watching a movie, and you could
step into that frequency and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Ah, I’ve just extended some more Love into the world. How did you do
over there?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s all available to you. You have never been separate one from
another, and those of you that are attracted to the expression of
<em>community</em> need to start putting that Truth into practice. You can join
with any mind of any brother and any sister anytime you want, if only to
extend power and love to them.</p>

<p>You don’t have time to stare at your soap operas any longer. You don’t
have time to sit in your easy chair, lamenting how tough your life is,
because your life and your world will be transformed when you learn to
do nothing but extend the Love of God with every breath you breathe.
Whenever the mind knows heaviness or doubt or loneliness, think upon
your brother and sister who has come with you to extend the Love of
Christ into this world—and empower them.</p>

<p>Guess what happens when you do that? As you give you receive. As you
empower your brother or sister, you will feel that power coursing
through <em>you</em>, and you will wonder what happened to your depression and
your doubt and your fear and your loneliness. It’s all just an illusion,
anyway.</p>

<p>Do you understand what I am saying to you?</p>

<p>You’ve learned to contract yourself, to separate yourself from the power
of Christ. How, then, do you find it? By giving it away.</p>

<p>Salvation can only be known by sharing it. So when you think you are
bored, you’ve washed all of your dishes, you’ve cleaned the cobwebs out
of your closet, you’ve washed the filth off your automobiles, you’ve put
the food into the belly of the body, you have paid all of your bills
unto Caesar and you think you’ve got nothing to do — Saturday night and
nowhere to go — think about your brothers and sisters, and do nothing
more than play with <em>empowering</em> them. Play at it and <em>love</em> it. Pretend
like you are the controller of the universe. Send the power of Christ to
your brother and your sister.</p>

<p>Hmm! Hmm.</p>

<p>Jeshua, I am answering your very joyful call. You showed up in a session
I was giving this afternoon and it was quite clear that I would move my
day and my evening a lot in order to come and be with you tonight. So I
am just here, and open to your reflection.</p>

<p>[Short pause]</p>

<p>I am with you always. Join with me until you see and hear me as easily
as you hear the voice that you are now hearing. Join with me so fully
that there is no longer a trace of distance between us. Time to upgrade,
shall we say, the frequency or power of the work that you do. But it’s
going to take leaps and bounds! Hmm.</p>

<p>Well, I have been feeling that. My daily awareness is to release,
release, allow. Really allow the lightness to come, the movement to
move. It feels so large at times that I keep wanting to damper it or
contract or take a breath, and basically I am daily just breathing
through and expanding.</p>

<p>A rather good idea.</p>

<p>Precious friend, have you not carried with you, even in the beautiful
work you do, have you not carried a chronic thought,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Am I truly worthy of total union with Christ?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Know you that feeling?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Let it be gone. Well have you known that I have been knocking upon the
door of your heart for a very long time.</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>Sometimes you let me come in and have a little cup of tea. But then you
say, “Oh, you have to leave now.”</p>

<p>Beloved friend, from this day, more powerfully than ever in the past,
when you do the work you do in what you call the initiation, you are
going to feel me standing next to you. And when you do your little
ritual, there will come a day when you will literally see me standing on
just the other side of the one you are doing your ritual with, and I am
going to join with you.</p>

<p>In other words, we are going to be working together at a new level to
increase the power and the transformation of that initiation.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Oh, I welcome it. I have actually been inviting you clearly in every
circle.</p>

<p>You have been inviting me but there has been this little shadow over in
the corner of the mind,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, could I really take it if he truly showed up?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Know you the trace of that feeling?</p>

<p>Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>Yes. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>Thank you for receiving my invitation to come to this gathering.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is my honor. My joy.</p>

<p>Yes, as it is mine. I have known you for a very long time, and you know
that.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>And you know that you are in Truth involved in your life’s purpose and
function in the work that you do. If you want to call it work. And you
are going to see it begin to accelerate.</p>

<p>The room is very full tonight</p>

<p>Standing room only.</p>

<p>Floating room only.</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>Jeshua, I notice when you have been using the word “time,“ you have a
different tone. I’m wondering about that. It feels different when you
use that. You are doing something with your frequency. I was curious.</p>

<p>Anyone else notice that?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Precious friend, you have perceived well. There is a shift of what you
perceive as frequency when I use that word tonight because it is a way
of intoning a certain power that can begin to actually break down the
perception or the limitations of time that seem to enshroud the mind and
the heart.</p>

<p>You are doing that with more than just that word.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Especially that one, more than others?</p>

<p>Tonight, especially that word. You could say it’s the lesson for today.</p>

<p>Time is a very important barrier that has been created in the mind that
is inhered in the illusion of separation. Time is the very thing that
needs to be transcended. Become the masters of time and you will
remember that you abide in eternity. It is going to be very, very
important in only a little bit of time. Are you truly choosing to master
the illusion of time? Or are you letting it continue to master you?</p>

<p>Remember always that time is given you for one reason and one reason
only. Does anybody remember what it is?</p>

<p>To extend Love.</p>

<p>Which is to do something I have stated to you probably thirty-five times
or more. To use it constructively. To construct, to let the creative
thought of God flow through you, so that what is created in the illusion
of time sends a message to your brother and sister that time is an
illusion and that only eternity is real; that time cannot be a barrier
or limit you in any way from communication with all of the gods and
goddesses that you have prayed for the opportunity to communicate with.
Time is an illusion that has been translated from a limitation to an
opportunity to express what is <em>unlimited</em>. Own it. Use it
constructively, and your constructive use of it will translate it into a
vehicle through which <em>you</em> become the Light of the world.</p>

<p>Does that help a little bit?</p>

<p>It is time.</p>

<p>That’s rather a paradox you’ve given us.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>What you experience <em>is</em> a paradox. Don’t try to make sense out of
anything that I come to teach you. <em>Just do it.</em> And in the doing of it,
you will witness miracles extended through you. And when you have seen
them extended through you into the life of your brothers and sisters,
you will have to finally admit that they have already been done to you.</p>

<p>Please, never, never, never, never in any moment of your day, never
choose to limit what I can do through you. If you could give me but one
gift, give that to me. Give to me your solemn promise that you will
never limit what I can do through you.</p>

<p>I promise.</p>

<p>And you are going to see the fruit of that promise.</p>

<p>I have.</p>

<p>Yes. Are you ready for it to expand exponentially?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Thank you, Father!</p>

<p>How are we all doing?</p>

<p>Okay. Time to stretch a little, I think.</p>

<p>Then, do so. No one is stopping you.</p>

<p>Yes, I am.</p>

<p>How about the rest of you?</p>

<p>Stretch time.</p>

<p>So, go ahead and take a short little break if you want. I am not going
to do what you would perceive as depart from this blending with my
beloved brother. But rather, instead, I am going to quicken it a little
bit. If ever you want to know what <em>you</em> have to be willing to release,
willing to release in order to join with me, have a little chat with my
beloved brother. Many of you have no idea what it takes to blend with me
like this although you would pray for it, and some of you have known
jealousy. Are you willing to let everything in you that is false <em>die</em>?
Are you willing to experience the pain of a thousand little deaths
within you as the ego becomes ashes? Why not give it a try? Hm. Indeed.</p>

<p>Are you truly willing to realize that throughout thousands of lifetimes
you haven’t known what in hell is going on? But you have judged the
world as though you did, because you have judged yourself as being
separate from God. That illusion is the cornerstone of the separate
self. Are you willing to loosen your fingers from it and let it become
as the dust of the ground? <em>That is death</em>. But from that death the
fullness of life can be born and you shall become the perfect servant of
the Atonement. The form may differ but the power of the miracles wrought
through you is the same. Become the one who allows only miracles.</p>

<p>Remember always that the purpose of the miracle, you see, is to shorten
the need for time. Therefore, use time constructively to allow miracles,
and miracles will shorten the need for time. Do you see how it all
works?</p>

<p>So, take your short little break. If you want to leave, by all means do
so, and do so with my love and my blessing. If would like to remain for
yet a little while, then please do so and we will see what happens.</p>

<p>I love you and I give you my peace, and until your strength is the same
as mine, please <em>use</em> mine. You can’t use it up and it’s freely given.
Therefore, never allow yourself to feel weak or frail or fearful. All
you have to do is to reach into your heart and pull out a handful of my
strength and my certainty until you’ve learned that that strength and
that certainty is yours and it cannot be taken from you.</p>

<p>I love you, because you are the Light of the world.</p>

<p>Peace be unto the only begotten Son of God, and I’ll be seeing you very
soon.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>{Break}</p>

<p>Jeshua I have a couple of questions. I am new and I have been enjoying
this evening very much, and I appreciate the reflections that you give
us of how to be, how to perceive to attain mastery of the self and peace
in the heart and quiet in the mind. I get to see all the ways that I
don’t do that, which is wonderful.</p>

<p>I have a question about a reference that you do make and I… how do I
say this? You had said to all of us to… When we are not feeling strong
to turn to you for our strength. Yes? Okay. And I have a question in
turn because I use a different terminology. The strength that you are
speaking of is the strength, of course, that comes from God, right?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Okay. My question is, I guess, why the need to go through <em>you</em>, to get
your strength, because I see your strength as the strength of God
Almighty moving through you, moving through each of us, and I have a
question about that. Do you understand what I am saying? I’m sure you
do.</p>

<p>I do, but do <em>you</em>?</p>

<p>Yeah. I think I do. Yeah. I just wanted to get clear. Do we need to go
by you or can we… you know …</p>

<p>I feel like the Source is one and the same. Is there a reason that maybe
those who need to lean on you were in that way because of whatever
relationship that they might… because they are connected
to you… they see you on these weekends and get a deeper connection. Is
that like a stepping stone or what are you saying when you are saying
that? Now I’m clear.</p>

<p>And you actually are giving the answer.</p>

<p>Now, first of all, I would say this: I am the Way, the Truth and the
Life and no man comes to the Father but by me. So if you haven’t done it
yet, learn how to pronounce the name “Jeshua,” because no other name
under heaven can bring you salvation!</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>I’m leaving!</p>

<p>Now, what does all of that mean?</p>

<p>Well have you spoken that there are some that come not only to these
Friday night gatherings and, therefore, see me as the vehicle through
which they come to remembrance of the holy union of Father and Son, but
indeed many who come unto these gatherings have known me throughout what
you would perceive as lifetimes.</p>

<p>There is something called holy lineage that is extremely important.
Imagine that a child sleeps in a meadow and begins to dream dreams of
many journeys and forgets that he sleeps in his Father’s arms. And he
begins to believe that the nightmares he is using his own creative power
to create have a power in themselves, and he learns the complexity upon
complexity and world upon world, and comes to actually believe he has
been separated from his Father’s Holy Kingdom.</p>

<p>Now, somewhere along the line — he might be a cobbler; he might be a
Roman soldier; he might be a member of the Sanhedrin; he might be
working in a court in Egypt — somewhere in one of those journeys he
hears a message. He sees someone that others call “Master.” And though
he does not know it, he has heard this message before and he is seeing
those who are its masters walking with him upon the Earth. Yet, for some
reason in this moment something is different. And as he hears the words
of that master being spoken, something begins to vibrate in the heart
and a little door opens and for just a moment he sees the union of
Father and Son. That is the beginning of a holy lineage, and though he
might close that door and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oh, not yet,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and go back to being a cobbler or what have you, and though he might
choose to travel through another hundred thousand worlds, when it is
time for the soul to take its final journey home, that soul shall make
sure that it comes back into contact with that lineage because it
becomes the doorway home.</p>

<p>I am the lineage for many and, therefore, especially in <em>this</em> work that
I do with my beloved brother because I am <em>his</em> lineage, I come forth
and use a certain language that identifies me as the one who walked and
talked as Jeshua Joseph ben Joseph. I talk about Abba, I talk about the
Holy Mother, I talk about the union of Father and Son, because this is a
language that those entrusted to me of my Father have known very, very
well. Most of them have known many incarnations within what you would
call the Judeo-Christian tradition. It is a language that vibrates
within their soul, and so I come and I use it yet again. It is not, as
you know, the only one that could be used.</p>

<p>But those who come and resonate with what I say unto them, there are
many in this room that would nod their head and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oh, yes, I know Jeshua is my lineage.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your lineage is a little different but you appreciate the universality
of the Gospel that is expressed in these words, do you not?</p>

<p>Yes, very much.</p>

<p>Therefore, do not see it so much as a stepping stone but see it as the
enactment of the awakening of the Sonship. This same Gospel can be given
in many forms. As you know, yours is a bit different. And yet, when I
say that I am the Way and the Truth and the Life and that no man comes
to the Father but by me, I am speaking a Gospel that has been given in
many forms to any heart and mind that must come to realize that you
<em>are</em> Christ eternal. You <em>are</em> Jeshua. You are the power of the Light
that is the offspring of Light Divine. You are the Daughter of the
Goddess and, therefore, when you come to be fully identified in the core
of your own being as that same Love and Power and Wisdom that took form
as Jeshua, then indeed you have become the Way, the Truth and the Life.</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>That is wonderfully clear for me, and I really appreciate the
recognition, because I was aware that I had a different lineage and I
just wanted to get clear for myself and understand what was really going
on here, and what you were referring to, so that I could remain in honor
and love — my love for your words and your works that have been so
vastly written and talked and preached about. So, I thank you for that
very special message.</p>

<p>I do have a question that is personal. Is that okay to ask?</p>

<p>Oh, of course not.</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>No. This year I decided that I am… what you were talking earlier about
lack. I really want to be done with it. I mean, clearly done with it and
really trust. And as I have been declaring that I wanted to trust God
more in allowing that flow to happen with not so much fear coming in, of
course, fear comes blasting in my face — and I got ill from it and I had
to go through that whole recognition of letting go to another level of
vibration so that I could receive more, understand more. And there is a
part of me that recognizes there is a way I am <em>blocking</em> my abundance.
And I really want to be able to… I know that I will be able to move it
out of the way. However, I am not really clear on what it is that I need
to move, unless it is <em>the</em> big issue of totally trusting and just
having faith in every single moment of every single breath that I take
that all is well. My mind gets in the way. I don’t know if you have any
insight to share with me on this?</p>

<p>None. I haven’t the foggiest idea what you are talking about.</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>Okay, I’ll rephrase that.</p>

<p>No, you don’t need to.</p>

<p>I know that you know and I would like some help with this! Thank you.</p>

<p>Beloved friend, you have already given yourself the answer but you have
not understood it. Indeed, your mind gets in the way and the obstacle
that blocks it is the belief that there is an obstacle that <em>you</em> must
remove <em>before</em> you can receive the abundance.</p>

<p>Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>Beloved friend, do what I am about to suggest to you. Do it daily for a
period of twenty-one days. Fair enough?</p>

<p>Uh huh, fair enough.</p>

<p>Now, this is going to require that you do this twenty-four hours a day
and you do not eat or drink in the meantime.</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>Just kidding.</p>

<p>Now, when you arise in your morning, sit up, throw the shoulders back,
feel the spine lengthen, block not the angel of air, and say unto that
One who is the Teacher who teaches without error — the One I have called
the Holy Spirit — and ask Him to correct the <em>only</em> obstacle in you: ask
Him to correct the perception that an obstacle exists. As you breathe
the angel of air, let the body soften. Let it feel as though the cells
are becoming Light itself. You will feel that softness, and over the
course of these twenty-one days you will feel that state and know it
very well. And as that softness comes, simply say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Thank you, Holy Father, for I</em> am <em>healed.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Then go about your day. But as you go about the day, within your mind
ask that a higher vision be born through you. That’s all you need to do.
Do it with innocence, not trying to let the mind get caught up with
wondering what the vision might be. Just ask that it born through you.
In twenty-one days you are going to know that a deep healing and shift
has occurred. A certain perception will no longer arise and you won’t
even have noticed at first that it’s not in you any longer. And on
around the twenty-second or twenty-third day you are suddenly going to
be startled to realize that you will notice a certain weight is not with
you, and you won’t even know where it went.</p>

<p>Fair enough?</p>

<p>That is great, yes. Thank you.</p>

<p>You have much to do upon this plane and for you to move into the
fulfillment of part of your purpose is going to require that you become
a demonstration of one who is a teacher of God and one who lives in
unlimited abundance.</p>

<p>Somebody has to do it. What do you think?</p>

<p>That’s pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Don’t fear abundance of any kind, even of golden coins. But when they
come to you, remember what they are really for: to give the Love of God
away. Keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Okay. And my second question is personal. I came to a decision just
today, and I feel like it’s clear. I just want to ask you that I am not
copping out on part of . . . I’m not copping out. Okay. Go forward and
do it. Is that what you are saying? Okay. Thank you. That’s all, and I
appreciate your graciousness.</p>

<p>I appreciate the Light and the clarity and the power and the love and
the demonstration that you are about to bring and give unto this world.</p>

<p>That makes my palms sweat.</p>

<p>Jeshua, this woman started her question with a proclamation that was
quite profound, I thought. She said, “Jeshua, I’m new.“ It is the first
thing she said, and I rather liked it. So, can I say I am new, too?</p>

<p>Are you ready to be new?</p>

<p>I think so … Okay, I am ready.</p>

<p>There. All that “I hope” and “I think so.”</p>

<p>Great.</p>

<p>Yes. Indeed, beloved brother, is it not true that all things <em>are</em> being
made new for you? Is it not true that the perceptions have been dropping
away almost constantly, and that even in the midst of your day you
sometimes stop and realize that you are seeing things in a wholly new
way? Is that not true?</p>

<p>Yes, energies are changing.</p>

<p>Yes. Allow, allow, allow. Do not strive. Do not make. <em>Allow</em>. You know
what I mean by that?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Had any nice conversations with deceased entities lately?</p>

<p>I started to. I tried, but they weren’t very willing to listen.</p>

<p>That doesn’t matter. Talk to them anyway.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>What you perceive as their unwillingness means that you are just getting
caught up with the superficiality of their drama. Speak to the deeper
part.</p>

<p>You said… when you told me that there is a teacher that would help
me… can you be a little more specific about that? No? Let’s not. Okay.</p>

<p>I could, but I love you far too much to do anything which is a
disservice to you.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Allow, allow, allow.</p>

<p>Seems like such a simple message, and yet in this year you have realized
through revelation after revelation of the depths of the meaning of that
teaching: to allow. Is that not true my sister?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Continuing to learn it, aren’t you?</p>

<p>Uh huh.</p>

<p>It is the most important of Keys to the Kingdom, and because you’ve
begun to master the use of that key, it must necessarily come to pass
that you will quickly come to the completion of your journey and reside
where I am. The end is certain now. Allow it to be.</p>

<p>Surprise!</p>

<p>I have to hug the trees, huh?</p>

<p>Yes. You don’t <em>have</em> to hug them. You get to hug them. They are
waiting.</p>

<p>The day will come when you will understand the power and the
significance of doing just that. You will come to understand what it
really means in and for the depth of your soul.</p>

<p>Ah, nothing like enjoying the journey that another is taking in their
choice to awaken from dreams to reality. It brings <em>me</em> great joy to
watch each of your journeys, journeys no longer to spin in small circles
but journeys to awaken from the soil of separation and to burst forth as
the fragrance and the flowering of divine remembrance. Because well do I
know what is going to transpire upon this plane when the Sonship chooses
to be the flowering of awakening. It’s something worth working for,
throughout all of time.</p>

<p>You are all so very beautiful. In you there is so much Light, so much
love and so much radiance, so much wisdom and so much beauty that you
cannot contain it in the vessel of the human body. And when you choose
to let it shine fully, when you decide just to throw caution to the
wind — which is what I would call casting aside the belief in
limitation — so much Light will radiate through you that the time must
surely come to pass when the choice to manifest physical bodies will
have served its purpose and you will have moved beyond it. And even what
you call your world will dissolve in Light. Is that the end of creation?
Hardly. But it is the transcendence of one form of it. Let your Light so
shine before men that it is unmistakable — and you are the Light of the
world.</p>

<p>Many of you would do well to call your mothers and your fathers and your
brothers and your sisters and your children and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Guess what? I’m the arisen Christ. How are you doing today?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>Because, you see, when the thought comes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, I couldn’t do that</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>it means you just identified yourself with the illusion that <em>is</em> the
world. That’s how close you are in every moment.</p>

<p>I would rather say it in person than over the telephone.</p>

<p>Very good.</p>

<p>What would we do with the aghast responses we would get?</p>

<p>Love it. Because you will see they will say, “Of course you can’t be
that. What’s the matter with you?” And you sit there and smile back,
giving nothing but love because, you see, a master returns <em>all</em>
responses in love.</p>

<p>A master takes attack and returns love. A master takes condemnation and
returns love. A master takes disbelief and returns love. And sooner or
later they will stop and go, “Oh, my God, you are serious.” And then you
can smile and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oh, yes, I am quite serious.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And let them know that they are the same?</p>

<p>Exactly. Tell them that you are not going to stop loving them with the
Light of Christ until they remember that they, too, are that Light. Let
them know that you will be with them throughout the next one hundred
thousand incarnations if they so choose to do it that way, and <em>you</em>
will be the one who is with them always, even as the master Jeshua said,
“I am with you always.” Take the love that I give to you and give it to
your brother and sister. “For he that drinks from my mouth becomes as I
am and I shall become he or she.” That is what I mean when I say, “Take
my strength and use it until yours is as certain as mine.”</p>

<p>Need that take a long time? Time is an illusion. You can choose it now.
When you walk out of this building tonight, you can say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oh, Jeshua is my brother. We came from the same lineage. We have the
same divine parent. What is in him is in me also. Therefore, I am
going to love all others as he has loved me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you believe and feel that through my presence in your life, not just
this life, that the grace of our Father has thrown open the shutters of
your heart, then simply be as I am. Become the perfect servant of the
Grace of God. Lay down the dream of the dreamer and awaken as the
saviour of the world. Then my life has not been lived in vain. My death,
my burial, and my resurrection will have truly been filled with meaning,
because until <em>you</em> pick up your cross — which is made of Light — and
follow me, all that I have given unto you remains in vain.</p>

<p>If, therefore, you would love me, if, therefore, you would extend your
appreciation and thanks unto me, speak not in words to me, but go and do
likewise to your brother and your sister. For only in honoring the Son
within your own heart can you in Truth honor me. And when you have
extended that love unto your brother and sister, indeed, you will feel
me rejoice and you will know that, in Truth, I am with you always. And
we shall walk hand in hand as equals in the Kingdom of our blessed
Father, doing nothing but serving the Atonement because there is nothing
else to do. Join with me by being what I am. Of myself I do nothing but
my Father though me does all things. And my Father is <em>only</em> Love.</p>

<p>Therefore, be that which you are and you are the Love that my Father has
given to the world through me. Be, therefore, that which I am and <em>you</em>
are the Light of the world. Great is my love for you. Great, <em>great is
my love for you</em> because I know who you are even when you choose not to
believe it.</p>

<p>I cannot find words in your language to express the love I feel. Though
many of you forget about me during the course of your day, I forget you
not. And I look upon you in this illusion and I see naught but myself.
For have I not tried to teach you that the only thing you need to learn
is that there is nothing outside of you? All of creation is contained
within your Heart because you are the only begotten of the Father,
begotten before all worlds and of one substance eternally with all that
our Father is.</p>

<p>Oh, how can I not love you? How can I not love the Light of the world?
How can I not love the only creation of my Father, that which is eternal
and changeless?</p>

<p>Pure is your heart. Pure is your heart. You have never sinned. You are
Love in form. Give it to the world even as I have given that love to
you. Give it with every breath you breathe and gone will be your
depression and gone will be your doubt. Gone will be your lack. There
are no limitations in you. You can do it all because of yourselves you
do nothing, but your Father through you can do all things.</p>

<p>The body that you have thought yourself to be is <em>only</em> a vehicle of
communication.</p>

<p>Stop identifying with it, and identify with the Truth of your being. You
are Spirit and you are Divine. You have never known birth and you will
never taste death. This illusion is a game. Play it with the <em>infinite
joy of Christ</em>. Wherever you are, you are only there to be a
demonstration of what transcends the world.</p>

<p>Short is the time that I am given to be with you in this way and yet,
eternal is the time that I am with you. And though this world arises and
passes away in the twinkling of an eye, we are together throughout
eternity. Join with me; play with me.</p>

<p>You are already a master. Claim it. And when you are in a grocery store
buying the food that you would put into the body, take pause and
remember,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Ah, this mass of flesh that seems to be handing golden coins to the
one who seems to be separate from me and who seems to have a frown
upon their face and depression in their countenance because they do
something they hate, this little body is nothing more than a vehicle
to extend the Peace and Love of God.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Send that beam of Light through the heart of your very body and join
with the heart of the one across that little stand. Look them in the eye
and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the service you give me. I
love you for your willingness to do the work you do.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When they’ve picked up their chin, you will feel their countenance
shift. And though you may never see them again, they will remember you
always. And you have no idea of the seed you will have planted, because
they, in their turn, will begin to be quickened by your love. And it may
be the next day, it may be next week, they, too, will remember that they
can extend the love of Christ unto another. You will have started a
string of miracles, and there is absolutely nothing worth doing than
being the initiator of the string of miracles that awakens the Child of
God.</p>

<p>Would you do that with me? Would you choose to play in each day as the
one who can bring a miracle and give it to another? I need you as much
as some of you have believed you need me. I can work from planes unseen
but I can only join with so many bodies to do this kind of work. But
wherever you are, you can join with me and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Jeshua, I’m going to extend the love of Christ. Are you ready? Here
it goes.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And trust this: when you call upon me in order to extend that miracle,
rest assured I <em>am</em> with you. Some of you have already begun to see me,
even though your eyes are open, in the midst of other experiences
because you are beginning to get the message.</p>

<p>I am not limited by space and time. Nor are you. Join with me and play.
Play in the Spirit of Light of being the saviors of the world.</p>

<p>Would you please do that for me? Would you please promise to join with
me? Would you please in this moment let your decree be heard by your
brothers and sisters by just saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Yes, I will join with you in the salvation of the world.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Group repeats: “Yes, I will join with you in the salvation of the
world.”]</p>

<p>Ah, nothing like having some help!</p>

<p>[Laughter.]</p>

<p>Now, that means tomorrow when you arise and lift your head from the
pillow, leave your past behind you because it doesn’t exist. Let your
head rise and your body rise and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oh, boy, what a great day this is going to be because I am going to
give the love of Christ to this world. I am going to be vigilant in
every moment. Who can I give it to? What do you think, Jeshua? Is that
a good candidate?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I’ll say, “Oh, yes, indeed. Go and do so.”</p>

<p>Begin to play with it. Let the seriousness go. It has no place in the
Kingdom. Play with me! Dance with me! Sing with me! Rejoice with me!
Begin to have fun pushing buttons and blowing cobwebs away. So people
think you are a little crazy. So what? If the world is crazy — and I
assure you that it is — what will be perceived as <em>your</em> craziness is
actually a demonstration of sanity. There.</p>

<p>Contemplate this well tonight: “Into thy hands I commend my Spirit.”
Treat it well and give it away with love. Into thy hands, my brothers
and sisters, I commend my Spirit, and it is finished — whenever you
choose to be the Light of the world. And indeed I <em>am</em> with you always.</p>

<p>Go in peace. Remember this day to keep it holy. Remember this day to
keep it holy. Remember this day in every moment, and you are the Light
of the world.</p>

<p>You are my brothers and my sisters and you are my friends. I will never
abandon you and I will never forsake you; and even if you are not quite
of my lineage, sit down and have a cup of tea with me now and then.</p>

<p>Let it come to pass that in <em>this</em> hour and <em>this</em> day you shall go out
no more from our Father’s holy place. And indeed entrust your heart to
the Truth of your only reality.</p>

<p>Ask now and <em>receive</em> the fullness of that perfect wedding between our
Heavenly Father and our Earthly Mother that you might extend it as far
as from the East unto the West. Be the Light of the world. Go in peace
and <em>always</em> take me with you, because I have no other desire than to be
where the awakened Son of God is.</p>

<p>Peace be unto you.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
