</p>

<p><span class="capital">“A</span>re you okay?” asks Kendra.</p>

<p>“Huh?” For a moment I turn my head and look at her, then just as quickly
look away again. “Yeah, I’m fine,” I mutter halfheartedly, as I sink
back into the couch, resting my feet on the wicker chest that serves as
a coffee table.</p>

<p>Leaning forward from her position next to me, Kendra picks up her cup of
tea, takes an unhurried sip, then pauses with the cup held between her
hands. “Are you sure you are okay?”</p>

<p>I don’t want to talk about it. Yes, I do. No, I don’t. I have been
distracted all day. Begrudgingly, I realize that watching television is
not going to drown it out after all. Technology has failed me again.</p>

<p>“I had a, uh, rather interesting experience during meditation this
morning. I guess it is preoccupying me a bit.”</p>

<p>“A bit? That’s an understatement! You haven’t really been here since
your body walked through the door over an hour ago!” She puts her cup
down and leans back, slightly turned now so that she can look directly
at me. She is not going to let me out of this one.</p>

<p>I sigh, let my shoulders relax, and fall into the memory of what
happened this morning…</p>

<p>Let’s see. The iron is plugged in, so while it heats up I’ll just buzz
into the kitchen and make my morning smoothie. A little juice, a little
yogurt, two eggs, a dash of vanilla, one large banana, and two
tablespoons of spirulina. I hit the button on the blender, and in an
instant the whole thing is dark green.</p>

<p>“Ah, one of life’s beautiful pleasures,” I think to myself. A few gulps
later, the pleasure has disappeared.</p>

<p>Checking the iron, I frown. It is still not quite ready. Well, I can
make sure everything is in my briefcase. Papers? Check. Glasses? Check.
Pen? Check. Certs? Where are the Certs? Why am I always out of Certs? Is
there a Certs monster living in my briefcase?</p>

<p>I shrug my shoulders as I close my briefcase, setting it down in the
foyer. I just won’t get too close to anyone when I’m speaking today.</p>

<p>At last the iron is ready, and in a few minutes I am donning an almost
perfectly ironed shirt. Buttons are fastened and tails tucked in as I
head for the bedroom to grab a tie, when it happens.</p>

<p>Out of nowhere, and for no apparent reason, I am hit with the sudden
impulse to sit in meditation. The force of the thought is so powerful
that it quite literally stops me in my tracks.</p>

<p>Finally managing to recover, my only reaction is: “This is absurd. I am
not scurrying about like this because I have time to kill.”
Nevertheless, the thought persists (if you can call a feeling that
resounds throughout your body and is also a voice seemingly coming from
all around you, a ‘thought’).</p>

<p>In fact, the experience is so impactful that my priorities suddenly
switch as I walk back out to the living room, and plop down on the
couch. Crossing my legs, I glance for a moment out the window at the
waters of Puget Sound, where a tanker slowly makes its way past Vashon
Island.</p>

<p>“Really, this is absurd.” The voice of reason is softer now, making one
last attempt to win my attention.</p>

<p>I begin to breathe softly, gently, rhythmically. In time my eyes
naturally close, and I am increasingly aware of the myriad of thoughts
whirling arid swirling and tumbling through my mind. At first they seem
to gobble me up, eliciting momentary emotions, generating yet other
thoughts in reaction. Slowly I become more and more the witness of this
display of mindstuff, releasing attachment to content, resting more and
more into awareness itself.</p>

<p>There comes now a growing sense of peace, of ease, as when churning
waves begin to melt back into a vast and quiet sea. The thoughts grow
fewer and fewer, until there is only silence. My breath is barely
perceptible, sea of mind calm, clear, empty. That the meditation
experience has been reduced to physiological mechanisms of the
“relaxation response” by the God of Science means little when compared
to the feeling of this most marvelous experience. It is the most natural
of the most natural.</p>

<p>Perfect stillness begins to give way, but not to the usual rebirth of
thoughts. Out of emptiness there emerges a soft, golden light, like a
pinprick star in the dark of night. It grows effortlessly, steadily,
expanding and expanding, coming closer and closer until it completely
fills the field of my inner vision, until it suffuses my entire being,
until there is nothing but that supernal light.</p>

<p>Kendra has been listening with rapt attention as I describe the
experience.</p>

<p>“That’s it, Kendra. I know this probably sounds corny, but that is it.”</p>

<p>She has a puzzled look on her face, so needs to say nothing.</p>

<p>“I mean, that place, that <em>feeling</em>. If I could <em>live</em> in that feeling, that
place, there would be nowhere else to go, nothing to strive for, nothing
and nowhere to be or become. Am I making sense?”</p>

<p>Why is she smiling? Why are her eyes glowing?</p>

<p>“Oh, Marc! That is wonderful!” Kendra softens a bit, then continues.
“You are very fortunate, you know.”</p>

<p>Her statement stops me. I stare at her for a long while.</p>

<p>“Fortunate? Kendra…”</p>

<p>“Marc,” she interrupts, “do you know how many people would love to
experience that state? You are the one who has a library full of books
from every culture, every philosophical perspective, every religion. You
know that, at their heart, they all talk in varying terms of this type
of experience.”</p>

<p>She has obviously missed the point. Probably because I hedged a bit when
I recounted the story. I notice my breath coming a little faster now,
and feel a growing tension in my jaw.</p>

<p>Kendra is silent, but her eyes are riveted on me, silently questioning
my lack of enthusiasm. No longer able to hold it within myself, I break
the silence. “It’s that, uh, well, there was a little more to it than
that.”</p>

<p>“More to it? What was more to it? Marc,” she asks imploringly, “what is
more to it?”</p>

<p>“Kendra,” I pause and turn to look at her, “do you promise not to, well,
say anything?”</p>

<p>“You aren’t ever going to be able to say anything again if you don’t
fess up!” she cries as she lovingly, but not so gently, pokes me in the
ribs.</p>

<p>I look away, not at anything in particular, but rather back into a
memory still fresh and alive, the kind of memory that I somehow know
will <em>always</em> remain that clear.</p>

<p>“I opened my eyes, and the pinprick of light was right in the center of
the room. Out of the heart of that light there began to emerge a form,
an image of someone. It appeared as if it were dressed in long, radiant
robes of some kind. The form began gliding toward me, becoming more and
more distinct, and yet was surely identical with the Light from which it
sprang.”</p>

<p>Growing more comfortable with the sharing of this experience, I turn to
look at Kendra. “As the form came closer, I suddenly recognized him. It
was as if a friend not seen for many years has just walked around the
corner, and in the instant you lay your eyes on him you <em>know</em> who it is
without asking, without any deliberation. But in this case there was
also the recognition that I had not seen him with my physical eyes. Does
that make sense?”</p>

<p>Kendra’s face reveals her answer: one of agreement, of acceptance - one
that allows me to continue.</p>

<p>“He came closer and closer, and I felt an increasing intensity of
energy, like waves of joy and warmth, until his eyes were all I could
see. And then his eyes seemed to pour right through me, and I felt like
I was dissolving into them, into those incredibly peaceful eyes.”</p>

<p>Pausing now, I am not certain whether to continue, but Kendra is not
about to let me stop. Her expression is one of curiosity. She studies me
for a moment.</p>

<p>Damn. Now I am cornered. I have seen that look before. She is not going
to let me go anywhere until I confess all.</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“He communicated with me, or to me, I guess.”</p>

<p>“And?” She won’t even let me catch my breath now. “What did he say?”</p>

<p>My shoulders begin to hunch a bit, chin dropping to my chest. “He said
that he has a message to deliver to me. He said it was about the work he
is doing, or something like that.”</p>

<p>“And?”</p>

<p>She can be so unrelenting!</p>

<p>Why am I struggling with this? Kendra has been with me through it all.
Every high, every low. Even the very lowest of lows. She knows me better
than anyone - maybe even better than I know myself - and she still loves
me! If that is not a miracle, then there are no miracles.</p>

<p>The hell with it. The FBI she is not. I blurt out the rest. “He said I
had known him during his lifetime, and he, uh, he told me his name,”</p>

<p>I continue softly. “It is a name, a lifetime, which has been an enigma,
it seems, for the whole world.”</p>

<p>“Well? If you are attempting to try my patience, you are succeeding!”</p>

<p>“Okay, okay! He said I am familiar with him as ‘Jeshua.’”</p>

<p>“You mean <em>theeee</em> Jeshua? The one we all know as Jesus?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, <em>that</em> Jeshua.”</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>Now Kendra is quite animated. “Well, what else did he say? What is his
message? Oh, Marc, this is more marvelous than I thought, than I <em>can</em>
think! What is he going to, when is he…?”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” I throw up my hands, demanding silence.</p>

<p>“What is so marvelous about it all? Kendra, out of the heart of a nice,
peaceful meditation, this being has emerged, announced casually that his
name is Jeshua, that he was, and is, known as Jesus, that he is going to
give me some message, and to, well, to top it off, he said that I knew
him!”</p>

<p>“So, what’s the big deal?”</p>

<p>“What’s the big deal? God, do you think I want this to happen? Look, I
will admit that I am open to reading about this kind of thing, but, it’s
just that, well…”</p>

<p>She places her hand on my arm. “It is just that <em>what</em>, Marc?”</p>

<p>“It is just that this scares me. I mean, it’s all well and good to
examine metaphysics and the like from the standpoint of an observer.
That is what the intellect gives us: room between us and the experience
itself! Nothing has to change, you see? I can read books, go to
workshops and lectures, do all that sort of thing, but part of me can
still be safe! Besides, what if it is all one big ego trip? What if I am
making it all up?”</p>

<p>Her smile fades as she realizes my fear is real. She sits reflectively
for a moment, takes a cigarette out of the pack sitting next to her cup
of tea, picks up her lighter, then relaxes back into the sofa.</p>

<p>Still looking down, she asks: “Do you remember what I shared with you
about my session with Jeremiah?”</p>

<p>Her question seems to trigger the memory, and it all rushes forward into
my consciousness, as if someone had slipped by the security guards to my
archives, picked a file off an obscure shelf in a dimly lit corner, and
blown the dust off, revealing the label:</p>

<p class="indent">Jeremiah. Nonphysical entity channeled by Billie<br />
Ogden. Kendra is given bizarre, unverifiable<br />
information March 1987. File for future reference.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I remember. We met for lunch at that cafe in Ballard.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember what I shared with you?”</p>

<p>“Sort of.”</p>

<p>She knows I just don’t want to open the file on this. Recognizing my
reluctance, she sits up a little straighter and speaks more firmly.
“Jeremiah, if you will remember, gave me some rather startling
information about you, me, and about Jesus. Don’t you recall how excited
I was about it?”</p>

<p>“Okay, okay. I remember, but I’d conveniently forgotten it, until now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it’s interesting that a channeled entity you have never
even seen would say that you and I had known each other then, and that
we had been present when Jesus gave his Sermon on the Mount? And I
hadn’t even mentioned your name!”</p>

<p>I wince. Now it is my turn to pick up a cigarette. I turn it over and
over in my hand, watching little strands of tobacco spill out. I don’t
even smoke.</p>

<p>Kendra continues. “I told you then, and I’ll tell you again. When
Jeremiah said that, it was like somebody throwing the shutters open.
Marc, there just isn’t any doubt in my mind about it, even if you insist
that it is too far-fetched. And now you are essentially being told
something similar. Why are you having such a hard time with this?”</p>

<p>Tired of picking off strands of tobacco from between my fingers, I toss
the cigarette down.</p>

<p>“You could always go see Jeremiah, and ask him what is going on.”</p>

<p>I sigh, get up off the sofa, and stroll over to the glass doors, opening
them a bit wider in order to feel the breeze which is beginning to kick
up. It is probably a scout from the rain gods always hiding in the
Northwest.</p>

<p>The thought of dealing with yet another one of those invisible souls -
or entities, or discarnate beings, or whatever they are - is just not
very attractive to me.</p>

<p>I begin speaking without turning to face her. “You know, nearly three
years ago I was riding in the back of a friend’s car, on the way home
from Seattle where we had been attending a business seminar. In the
midst of our conversation, Lyndia turned to me and suggested that I go
see Jonah, that she had just been hit with the feeling that it would be
good for me to do. Heck, I thought she was talking about a band or
something. She hesitated, then explained that Jonah was a channeled
entity.”</p>

<p>Turning back to Kendra now, I continue. “God, the hair stood up on my
arms! But then I realized it wasn’t because of fear; it was because her
suggestion was, well, right. I had never even remotely considered such a
thing; it smacked of fairytale ‘woo woo’ stuff. But I went. And somehow
nothing has ever been quite the same. It was as if Jonah knew why I had
come, and he left no doubt that he knew me through and through.”</p>

<p>Returning to the couch, I plop myself down. Kendra still has not lit her
cigarette, which is just fine with me.</p>

<p>“He said some things that sent wavelike sensations through me,
sensations that were some sort of recognition of the truth of what he
shared. Some of what he said keeps rising to the surface of my mind from
time to time, and I remember knowing somehow that it was particularly
important, though I had no idea why it felt that way. He said:</p>

<p class="indent">My friend, ye have been what would be termed<br />
as a philosopher many times.<br />
Is it not so again?<br />
Indeed, ye were -<br />
in that which ye would understand<br />
as “past incarnation” -<br />
associated with that of a Great One,<br />
a great master.<br />
Be of assuredness ye were not this Great One,<br />
but ye were in association with this one.</p>

<p>I look at Kendra and quickly anticipate her question. “No, it never
occurred to me to ask who this ‘Great One’ was. As he spoke I was
getting pins and needles up and down my spine. I couldn’t think, let
alone talk. In fact, Jonah said it would be good to pause, as I had much
to ponder.</p>

<p>“Since then, I have had a rash of what might be called ‘mystical’
experiences, not to mention odd coincidences, hunches, and feeling drawn
to people and books - as if some invisible magnet was pulling me first
one direction, then another. And then, one innocent Saturday morning, I
heard Jonah speaking to me. I jumped out of bed and scribbled down the
words, complete with his trademark phrases like ‘for goodness sakes’ and
‘ye’ instead of ‘you.’ Do you have any idea how wary I was of that?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do! And don’t forget the time at the lecture in Bellevue,
when you heard him tell you he would speak directly to you - hours
before the evening actually started and then he got up and walked right
to you, basically announcing to everyone that he had been communicating
with you.”</p>

<p>It is not a memory one can forget, but she knows that.</p>

<p>“Yes! And I was, I <em>am</em>, still wary!”</p>

<p>She finally lights her cigarette, and takes a long, reflective draw of
it. “You know, Marc, if you are suspicious of Jeremiah, you could always
ask Jonah.</p>

<p>My reply takes no forethought. “Kendra, I just don’t want to run off and
ask some being who somehow inhabits a human body from time to time what
I am experiencing right now. But I will leave my options open, okay? I
prefer to work on this myself.”</p>

<p>She is watching, studying me. I can feel it. What subtle information is
she picking up?</p>

<p>“For over three years now you have cultivated a deep admiration for the
love and guidance Jonah gives, and you also know from experience that
his counsel is impeccable. What could he possibly say that frightens you
so?”</p>

<p>That’s it. That is what she was picking up. Fear.</p>

<p>I turn a bit toward her, bending my leg and placing my foot under the
other thigh. It doesn’t feel right, so I try the other way. It’s no good
either. Finally I put my feet back on the floor. “Look, it seems to me
that there are only two options here. Jonah could either reply that it
is happening, or he could reply that it is not happening - that it is
all my grandiose imagination.”</p>

<p>Kendra looks baffled. “So what’s wrong with that?”</p>

<p>“Kendra, don’t you see? If it is happening, then I will have to do
something with it! And if I am somehow making it all up, I really <em>will</em>
have a problem to deal with, the kind that usually requires the help of
a shrink, who will probably have to visit me on his rounds at Western
State Hospital!”</p>

<p>“Is that what you are afraid of?”</p>

<p>“I think I am afraid of <em>both</em> outcomes. Right now, I would just as soon
avoid the whole issue.”</p>

<p>“Look, aren’t you ultimately in control here? Why not go with this for
awhile, and if it doesn’t seem right you can always chuck it. You do not
have to share any of it with anyone if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p>She is right of course. The obvious truth seems to calm me a bit. I’m
breathing easier now.</p>

<p>“Well, Jeshua did say that I should begin writing down whatever is
communicated. That if, when he is present, I would simply focus my
awareness on him as I open my eyes, I will be able to maintain the
connection. I don’t suppose that could possibly hurt anything, could
it?”</p>

<p>Turning my head toward the window, I notice that the warm summer sun has
disappeared behind a small bank of deep blue clouds hovering over the
top of Vashon Island. The rain gods have revealed themselves.</p>

<p>Without turning back, I continue speaking. “There is one other thing. I
realized this morning that it is not the first time I have had this
contact.”</p>

<p>Kendra sits up quickly, resting her hand on my arm. “It isn’t? When…?”</p>

<p>“A few weeks ago, when we were all camping at the beach.”</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>It is early morning, the dawn beginning to melt away the night. I walk
along a sandy shore at water’s edge, gazing first to the right, out to a
cloudless horizon; then ahead to distant, steep cliffs, where a barely
perceptible waterfall pours silently down to meet the sea, crashing
majestically into giant boulders at the base of the cliffs.</p>

<p>An eagle suddenly leaves its perch high atop the towering evergreens
that blanket the sloping hillsides to the left. Its giant wings move
powerfully through the air; piercing eyes survey all that lies below.
There is no question whose country this is.</p>

<p>It has become a habit. Since we first stumbled upon this glorious place,
we have come here at least once a year. Building camps out of the
plentiful driftwood, exploring the endless pools created by the outgoing
tides, and standing awestruck beneath a canopy of stars that simply
cannot be seen anywhere remotely near civilization. Luckily it is not
one of those beaches found easily, unless one already knows the way.</p>

<p>I walk from our camp to the northernmost end of the beach, eyes dancing
momentarily with the eagle soaring across an empty sky. I come to my
favorite “just sitting” rock, large enough to keep me just above the
surf. Squatting on my haunches and watching the surf pound against the
rock, I begin to sense an incredible grace and beauty: the rock and the
surf are playing together. Staring down at this exquisite interplay, the
rhythm penetrates me until I feel what I hear.</p>

<p>There is an odd feeling beginning to grow within me. Not quite like an
ache, and certainly not painful. It is more like a faint hum, a
vibration. I feel it in the center of my body, near my heart. Moving
now, it expands as it rises to fill my head. It seems so odd to be both
feeling and passively witnessing this strange little phenomenon.</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>Hello, Marc.</p>
</div>

<p>The words emerge out of that vibration, as clear and distinct as if
someone were talking into my ear. With them, the vibration seems to have
changed somehow, and I begin to feel an energy, a warmth, unlike any
sensation I have ever felt. It is sublime, and peaceful beyond
description.</p>

<p>The words startle me, for there is an unmistakable sense of familiarity,
as when the person you love most in the whole world calls and, when you
answer the phone, they simply say “hello” and you know who it is.</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>I am glad that you have come to this point<br />
of being willing to allow<br />
this communication to take place.<br />
Rest assured that I will be speaking with you more<br />
often in the future</p>

</div>

<p>I cannot maintain the connection. The energy fades, and I again hear the
surf pounding in its dance against the boulder just below me. I see the
sunlight flicker across the ocean, and I feel the breeze - now blowing
strongly - against my skin. I realize that I have not been aware of any
of these things: not surf, nor breeze, nor sunlight.</p>

<p>Shaking my head, I rise, but painfully. My legs are stiff. How long have
I been sitting like this?</p>

<p>What was that?” I mutter to myself as, finally, I am able to move my
legs. Climbing carefully off the boulder, I jump the last few feet down
into the sand warmed by a sun which has now risen quite high into the
morning sky.</p>

<p>I begin walking back to camp, and suddenly there is trepidation. I
resist. “No, it cannot be.” I know this being, somewhere within myself,
yet I cannot name him. Or perhaps I refuse to.</p>

<p>Back at camp, friends are stirring, breakfast begun. I sit quietly,
watching gentle waves roll into shore and recede back into the sea,
comforted by that timeless, rhythmic sound, while emotions stir
somewhere deep inside me as if from a place unknown. Or is it a place
merely forgotten?</p>

<p>“Do you want some more tea?” I ask, after recounting my experience at
the beach.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>Kendra doesn’t answer. She sits motionless, looking not so much at me as
<em>through</em> me.</p>

<p>I walk into the kitchen and put the kettle on to boil. “Peppermint
again?”</p>

<p>She gets up from the sofa, walks to the kitchen entrance, and leans
against the wall. I don’t think she heard me ask what kind of tea she
wants, so peppermint will have to do.</p>

<p>“I remember now.” Her voice is soft, eyes staring off into memories. “I
remember glancing over and seeing you sitting on that log, aimlessly
kicking your feet through the sand, just staring out at the ocean. It
struck me that something was going on with you, but it didn’t seem
appropriate to disturb you, so I continued helping with breakfast.”</p>

<p>I put the teabag in the ceramic pot and pour boiling water into it.
Replacing the lid, I turn back to the stove, this time remembering to
turn the heat off.</p>

<p>“Marc, I think you need to accept that something is going on here, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>I take the lid off the teapot, bend over and peer into the now slightly
colored water, steam rising to warm my cheeks. Yep, it is starting to
smell like peppermint.</p>

<p>Replacing the lid, I turn to face her. “Yeah, something is happening
here. But it perplexes me, to say the least. I didn’t ask for it, and I
don’t know what to do with it, or even why it is happening. I guess it
is a little disorienting.”</p>

<p>“That is a brilliant observation!”</p>

<p>The sparkle in her eyes, together with a loving jab into my ribs, helps
release a growing pressure with me.</p>

<p>“You know, Kendra, the whole bent of my own spiritual path has been to
the East.”</p>

<p>My own statement triggers a stream of memories, still images sweeping
by, comprising the motion picture of my spiritual and philosophical
pursuits: initiation into the art of meditation nearly twenty years ago,
college days spent drinking in the sublime beauty of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em>,
the succinctness of Zen Buddhism, the rich and timeless mystical poetry
of the <em>Upanishads</em>, the fascinating story of the warrior Arjuna in the
<em>Bhagavad Gita</em>. Later, the transformative but sublime practice of yoga;
hours, weeks, months, years of postures; breathing; deepening awareness;
letting go in body, mind, and spirit; endless mantras dissolving into
the clear and empty space of samadhi. There were experiences of the
Siddhis, or “powers”; telepathy, astral travel, outofbody, pastlife
recognitions. Warned that these things are but passing phenomena, I had
let them go. All these images and more, swiftly seen in but an instant.</p>

<p>Our eyes meet, two friends so close that we do not so much share our
lives with one another as blend together. The boundaries of our separate
lives are grey, overlapping, flowing into and out of one another. She
already knows all these things.</p>

<p>“You know, if a god from the Hindu pantheon had appeared like Krishna,
or maybe Rama, or maybe a good ol’ Zen Patriarch, heck, the Buddha
himself! then I don’t think I would have any trouble with this. It would
fit, wouldn’t it? But Jesus? <em>Jeeeeezzzus</em>, Kendra!”</p>

<p>We stand and continue looking deep into each other’s eyes, recognizing
the unintended pun.</p>

<p>Finally, I break the silence. “You want that tea now?”</p>

<p>Kendra takes the cup, cradling it in both hands, savoring the warmth it
brings. Without looking up, she asks quietly: “Just what is a
philosopher, anyway?”</p>

<p>“It comes from Greek, two words, actually: ‘philo,’ which basically
means love, and ‘sophia,’ which means wisdom. Philo sophia: the love of
wisdom. A philosopher is a lover of wisdom.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>It is later in the day now, and I am alone. Sitting down on the couch
and crossing my legs, I relax, gazing into the last traces of a soft and
nurturing sunset.</p>

<p>My gaze becomes progressively less focused, my breathing calmer, more
rhythmic. It feels as if my eyes are withdrawing into my head and as has
happened before they begin to naturally draw upward. There is a
sensation, as if my consciousness is becoming focused in the front of my
brain, just at the back of my forehead. My surroundings begin to recede
from awareness, allowing recognition of an inner environment to emerge.</p>

<p>Now there is a sense of movement, and I am led by someone toward what
appears to be a door. It opens, and I glide forward through a tunnel of
magnificent, pulsating lights. As I near the end there is a bright
light, which begins to take on the form of a man in radiant garments.
The face is now familiar.</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>Now, we begin.</p>

  <p>Begin to open your eyes, Marc.<br />
Yet allow your awareness to rest with Me.</p>

</div>

<p>The words are both heard and seen, appearing against an empty backdrop.
But more than this, I can <em>feel</em> them.</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>I am the one<br />
the world knows<br />
as Jesus,<br />
and now you have come<br />
to where I AM.</p>

  <p>Our first meetings<br />
will be brief.<br />
It should be viewed as<br />
an exercise for you<br />
in learning to acclimate<br />
to what may be called My frequency.</p>

  <p>In truth,<br />
where I AM is never<br />
inaccessible to you,<br />
nor to any of the Father’s sons,<br />
for that is,<br />
of course<br />
who you are;<br />
each and everyone of you.<br />
And the time of remembrance<br />
is upon you.</p>

  <p>Who among you will choose to awaken<br />
from the dream you chose to dream<br />
so very long ago?<br />
What I will share with you<br />
during these first communications<br />
is not what you would call<br />
“profound wisdom.”</p>

  <p>However,<br />
if you dwell upon what I will share with you,<br />
it can, indeed,<br />
accelerate your own journey home.</p>

  <p>I have been with you always.<br />
Always,<br />
you have known Me.<br />
You are a servant of the Light<br />
many call God.<br />
It is all you have ever been,<br />
even throughout the many experiences -<br />
what you call “incarnations” -<br />
you created in order to hide<br />
from the truth you have always been.</p>

  <p>It is permissible<br />
to relinquish your dream.<br />
It can serve you no longer.<br />
It has brought you to the recognition -<br />
through your experience -<br />
of all the forms of avoidance<br />
the human soul has ever devised,<br />
all because it deems itself<br />
unworthy of its heritage!<br />
I will share with you<br />
My final message<br />
to the sons of the Living God.<br />
When this task is completed,<br />
I shall return to where I AM, awaiting the heralding<br />
of the New Age of Light<br />
upon this physical plane.<br />
It is soon to be manifest.</p>

  <p>Now,<br />
I will leave you.<br />
I would endeavor to impress upon you<br />
the conviction of the Truth you know.<br />
Trust your inner voice.<br />
It neither fails<br />
nor deceives you.</p>

  <p>It is in silent humility<br />
that the voice of the Father speaks.<br />
Do know that I,<br />
the one you know as Jeshua,<br />
am indeed with you always,<br />
throughout eternity.</p>

  <p>Rest in peace.</p>

  <p>Amen.</p>

</div>

<p>As his energy fades away I gradually come back to my everyday reality.
Come back? Where did I go? What went where? What does it mean to “come
to where I AM”? Where is that? What have I left without moving a muscle?
My “dream”? With a sudden start, I look around me; stereo, fireplace,
plants on the balcony moving in the wind.</p>

<p>I recall how Bishop Berkeley, an 18th-century philosopher, had once
argued that our experience is very much a dream. Having heard enough of
it, a student walked outside, shouting that he would refute the good
Bishop’s outlandish philosophy, and promptly kicked a stone with all his
might, breaking his toe! Of course, he had missed the point, but part of
me wants very much to kick the stone, too.</p>

<p>I begin to have a sneaking suspicion that I will not find an
understanding for this experience by looking around me. And that is
disconcerting.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p class="date omit">
  August 15, 1987
</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>Now, we begin.</p>

  <p>Such Love have I<br />
for the sons of God,<br />
be they momentarily identified<br />
as male or female for -<br />
in Truth -<br />
the Son is One.</p>

  <p>The Son is that<br />
which springs forth eternally<br />
from the Holy Father<br />
which is unspeakable,<br />
and yet is ever present fullness.</p>

  <p>Therefore,<br />
the Love I feel<br />
is the Love I AM.<br />
This term signifies<br />
not merely I as “Jeshua,”<br />
but the Truth and Reality<br />
of what we all are.</p>

  <p>Allow yourselves to feel<br />
the truth of this,<br />
that each and everyone of you<br />
is here but for one reason:<br />
to realize the Truth<br />
and to come home again.</p>

  <p>Never upon the earth<br />
has the opportunity to do so<br />
been such as it is now.<br />
Yet even when the son<br />
stands at the door and knocks,<br />
and the Father has opened the door,<br />
there remains a choice to be made.<br />
What will be your choice?</p>

  <p>Amen.</p>

</div>

<p>Kendra places the communication down on the table, but does not yet take
her eyes from it. “Sorry it took me so long to read. Your chicken
scratch is horrible!”</p>

<p>“It seems to come so fast that I can barely keep up with it. Even I have
a hard time reading my own writing. Maybe I should learn shorthand!”</p>

<p>Now she smiles, and lifts her eyes from the paper resting between us. “I
want you to know that it feels good to me, Marc. I encourage you to go
ahead with this thing, whatever it is to be.”</p>

<p>I fidget a little. God, it would be nice to have her say it all sounded
trite and worthless.</p>

<p>“‘The Son is One.’ When he said that, it struck me quite deeply, but,
hell, I don’t know.” I get out of my chair and walk over to check on the
ming tree. I never check the plants. Even though I profess to love
houseplants, it’s possible they could be dead for months before I would
notice.</p>

<p>“Marc, may I make a suggestion?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Suggest away!”</p>

<p>“When you go on vacation to Molokai in a few weeks, why not spend some
time contemplating all this? Maybe you’ll get some answers on why it’s
happening and on what is happening. It seems important to me, somehow.
What do you think?”</p>

<p>I do not need to think about that suggestion. “No way! The last thing I
want to do is try to figure this out. I am going to kick back, unwind,
and just be a normal tourist. My main task is to soak up as much of that
glorious Hawaiian sun as possible, and <em>all</em> my energy is going into
that!”</p>

<p>I guess the plant will live, even with my negligence. Returning to the
table, I plop down in the chair and pick up the communication.</p>

<p>“Look, I feel that I do need to go with this experience. Yet something
in me doesn’t really want to. But I know that I can always burn the
stuff, or at least tuck it away in a box and bury it somewhere.”</p>

<p>“So what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“For now, not much. If and when it happens, it happens. What I <em>will</em> do
is make sure I’m never too far from a writing tablet, and, heck, if any
more communications come, maybe I’ll jot down a few notes. You know:
where I am, what is going on, that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>A smile breaks across my face, and I look at Kendra.</p>

<p>She returns my smile, with a question. “What are you thinking?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just got this image of my grandchildren opening an old trunk
filled with their grandpa’s artifacts, including these old and yellowed
pages of weird notes and conversations with an invisible friend. When
they ask their mom about it, she’ll reply, ‘Well, that’s why they had to
lock your grandpa up, dear! Now you just put that away and go play out
in the yard.’”</p>

<p>Kendra is laughing now, shaking her head. “You have such a weird sense
of humor!”</p>

<p>A few moments pass, and now she looks at me, a bit more thoughtfully.
“Marc, how did you feel about Jesus while you were growing up?”</p>

<p>The sudden shift in our conversation catches me off guard, and seems to
unlock a chestful of memories. I see myself going to church on Sundays
with my parents. Endless rounds of sermons and Sunday school lessons.
<em>That</em> part I didn’t like very much.</p>

<p>“My father would drop me off in front of the church for Sunday school,
and I would pretend to be heading inside, but as soon as he was around
the corner, off I would be! I would go downtown and spend my offering on
a chocolate shake.”</p>

<p>Kendra’s eyes are wide with surprise, but they are smiling. “You!
That’s, that’s almost sacrilegious!”</p>

<p>I smile at the memory. “Well, hang me at dawn. But I remember feeling
very good about Jesus, when I could manage to separate him from all the
dogma. I felt like here was this being who knew something. I mean,
<em>really</em> knew something. I felt like he was somebody you could really
trust.”</p>

<p>Her voice becomes a little softer now. “Why can’t you trust him now?”</p>

<p>“Kendra! That was a Jesus coming to me through someone else’s filter! He
lived in stories, and told parables that were like Rorschach ink blots.
And he lived safely in history! That Jesus is easy to trust! You can
believe anything about him you want to, and how is he going to defend
himself?”</p>

<p>Without moving her head, she lifts her eyes and looks directly at me.
“Maybe by making house calls.”</p>

<p>She has stopped me dead in my tracks.</p>

<p>“Are you saying that you believe this Jeshua is that Jesus?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that what he said?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but…”</p>

<p>“How did it <em>feel</em> when he said it?”</p>

<p>She rests her chin in her hand now, and looks right at me.</p>

<p>Turning my head to look out the window, I answer her softly. “As good
and as real as those chocolate shakes used to taste.”</p>

<p>But I can’t let it go at that. Emotion begins to build within me; a
struggle to remain convinced that Jeshua is not Jesus. No matter what it
feels like to me, this experience just cannot be <em>real</em>. Well, not that
real.</p>

<p>“Look, Jesus lives in the pages of the Bible, and in obscure esoteric
texts, and in the hopes of some people’s hearts, but I cannot believe
that he appears out of some field of light during the course of a
meditation in twentieth-century America!”</p>

<p>I drop my head a bit. “Besides, even if he does, this is not the message
empires have been built on, that millions of people have pinned the
hopes of their soul on. God, Kendra, I can’t share a message like this,
from such a source as him! They’d, they’d…”</p>

<p>“Crucify you?” she completes my thought, with more than a slightly
bemused look on her face.</p>

<p>“Yes!” I blurt out my reply, then quickly catch myself. “Well, probably
not literally, but I just don’t want the hassle.”</p>

<p>We both grow quiet. “Marc.”</p>

<p>“Yeah?”</p>

<p>“What if ‘they’ have been wrong?”</p>
