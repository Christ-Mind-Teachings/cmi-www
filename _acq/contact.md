  Welcome to the Library of Christ Mind Teachings. My name is Rick Mercer.
  </p>
  <p>
  My journey began with <em>A Course In Miracles</em> and followed on to <em>The Way of Mastery</em>, <em>The Raj Material</em> and, most recently, <em>A Course of Love</em>. I hear the same voice in all of them saying the same thing in somewhat different ways. There is profound wisdom here that is clearly not of this world.
  </p>
  <p>
  The Library makes this material easily accessible to everyone and integrates the various pieces. The <em>Search</em> feature supports discovery and <em>Bookmarks and Annotations</em> allow for easy lookup and sharing. 
  </p>
  <p>
  I hope you enjoy using and discovering the wisdom in these pages and allow it to transform your life.
  </p>
  <p>
  I would love to hear from you about any subject. You can especially support this project by reporting any errors you find and by suggesting new features and the addition of other teachings. Thank you!
