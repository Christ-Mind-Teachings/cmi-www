    <p>Sit quietly and look upon the world you see, and tell yourself,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“The real world is not like this. It has no buildings, and there are
no streets where people walk alone and separate. There are no stores
where people buy an endless list of things they do not need. It is not
lit with artificial light, and night comes not upon it. There is no
day that brightens and grows dim. There is no loss. Nothing is there
but shines, and shines forever.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The world YOU see must be DENIED, for sight of it is costing you a
different kind of vision. YOU CANNOT SEE BOTH WORLDS, for each of them
involves a different kind of seeing and depends on what you cherish. The
sight of one is possible BECAUSE you have denied the other. Both are not
true, yet either one will seem as real to you as the amount to which you
hold it dear. And yet their power is NOT the same because their real
attraction to you is unequal.</p>

<p>You do not really want the world you see, for it has disappointed you
since time began. The homes you built have never sheltered you. The roads
you made have led you nowhere, and no city that you built has withstood
the crumbling assault of time. Nothing you made but has the mark of
death upon it. Hold it not dear, for it is old and tired, and ready to
return to dust even as you made it. This aching world has not the power
to touch the living world at all. You could not give it that, and so
although you turn in sadness from it, you cannot find in IT the road
that leads away from it into another world.</p>

<p>Yet the real world has the power to touch you even here BECAUSE YOU LOVE
IT. And what you call with love WILL come
to you. Love always answers, being unable to deny a call for help, or
not to hear the cries of pain that rise to it from every part of this
strange world you made but do not want. The only effort you need make to
give this world away in glad exchange for what you did not make is
willingness to learn THE ONE YOU MADE IS FALSE.</p>

<p>You HAVE been wrong about the world because you have misjudged YOURSELF.
From such a twisted reference point what COULD you see? All vision
starts WITH THE PERCEIVER, who judges what is true and what is false.
And what he judges false HE DOES NOT SEE. You who would judge reality
CANNOT see it, for whenever judgement enters reality has slipped
away. The out of mind is out of sight because what is denied is there,
but is not RECOGNIZED. Christ is still there, although you know Him not.
His Being does not depend upon your recognition. He lives within you in
the quiet present, and waits for you to leave the past behind and enter
into the world He holds out to you in love.</p>

<p>No-one in this distracted world but has seen some glimpses of the other
world about him. Yet while he still lays value on his own, he will DENY
the vision of the other world, maintaining that he loves what he loves
not, and following not the road that love points out. Love leads so
gladly! And as you follow Him, you will rejoice that you have found His
company, and learned of Him the joyful journey home. You wait but for
YOURSELF. To give this sad world over and exchange your errors for the
peace of God is but YOUR will. And Christ will ALWAYS offer you the Will
of God, in recognition that you share it with Him.</p>

<p>It is God’s Will that nothing touch His Son except Himself, and nothing
else comes nigh unto him. He is as safe from pain as God Himself,Who
watches over him in everything. The world about him shines with love
because God placed him in Himself where pain is not, and love surrounds
him without end or flaw. Disturbance of his peace can never be. In
perfect sanity he looks on love, for it is all about him and within him.
He MUST deny the world of pain the instant he perceives the arms of love
around him. And from this point of safety he looks quietly about him,
and recognizes that the world is one with him.</p>

<p>The peace of God passeth your understanding ONLY in the
past. Yet here it IS, and you can understand it NOW. God loves His Son
forever, and His Son RETURNS his Father’s Love forever. The real world
is the way that leads you to remembrance of this one thing that is
wholly true and wholly YOURS. For all else you have lent yourself in
time, and it will fade. But this one thing is ALWAYS yours, being the
gift of God unto His Son. Your ONE reality was given you, and by it God
created you as one with Him.</p>

<p>You will first dream of peace, and then awaken to it. Your first
exchange of what you made for what you want is the exchange of
nightmares for the happy dreams of love. In these lie your true
perceptions, for the Holy Spirit corrects the world of dreams where ALL
perception is. Knowledge needs no correction. Yet the dreams of love lead
UNTO knowledge. In them you see nothing fearful, and because of this
they are the welcome that you OFFER knowledge. Love waits on welcome,
NOT on time, and the real world is but your welcome of what always was.
Therefore the call of joy is in it, and your glad response is your
awakening to what you have not lost. Praise, then, the Father for the
perfect sanity of His most holy Son.</p>

<p>Your Father knoweth that you have need of nothing. In Heaven this is so,
for what could you need in eternity? In YOUR world you DO need things
because it is a world of scarcity in which you find yourself BECAUSE you
are lacking. Yet CAN you find yourself in such a world? Without the Holy
Spirit the answer would be no. Yet because of Him the answer is a joyous
YES! As Mediator between the two worlds, He knows what you have need of
and what will not hurt you. Ownership is a dangerous concept if it is
left to you. The ego wants to HAVE things for salvation, for possession
is its law. Possession for its OWN sake is the ego’s fundamental creed,
a basic cornerstone in the churches that it builds unto itself. And at
ITS altar it demands you lay ALL of the things it bids you get, leaving
you no joy in them.</p>

<p>Everything that the ego tells you that you need will hurt you. For
although the ego urges you again and again to GET, it leaves you
nothing, for what you get it will DEMAND of you. And even from the very
hands that grasped it, it will be wrenched and hurled into the dust. For
where the ego sees salvation it sees SEPARATION, and so you lose
whatever you have gotten in its name. Therefore ask not
of yourselves what you need, for YOU DO NOT KNOW, and your advice unto
yourself WILL hurt you. For what you think you need will merely serve to
tighten up your world AGAINST the light, and render you unwilling to
question the value that this world can really hold for you.</p>

<p>Only the Holy Spirit KNOWS what you need. For He will give you all
things that do not block the way to light. And what else COULD you need?
In time, He gives you all the things that you need have, and will renew
them as long as you have need of them. He will take nothing from you as
long as you have ANY need of it. And yet He knows that everything you
need is temporary, and will but last until you step aside from ALL your
needs, and learn that all of them HAVE BEEN fulfilled. Therefore He has
no investment in the things that He supplies except to make certain that
you will not use them on behalf of lingering in time. He knows that you
are not at home there, and He wills no delay to wait upon your joyous
home-coming.</p>

<p>Leave, then, your needs to Him. He will supply them with no emphasis at
all upon them. What comes to you of Him comes safely, for He will ensure
it never can become a dark spot, hidden in your mind, and kept to hurt
you. Under His guidance you will travel light and journey lightly, for
His sight is ever on the journey’s end, which is His goal. God’s Son is
not a traveller through OUTER worlds. However holy his perception may
become, no world outside himself holds his inheritance. Within himself
he HAS no needs, for light needs nothing but to shine in peace, and from
itself to let the rays extend in quiet to infinity.</p>

<p>Whenever you are tempted to undertake a foolish journey that would lead
AWAY from light, remember what you really want, and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Holy Spirit leads me unto Christ, and where else would I go?<br />
What need have I but to awake in Him?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then follow Him in joy, with faith that He will lead you safely through
all dangers to your peace of mind that this world sets before you. Kneel
not before the altars to sacrifice, and seek not what you will surely
lose. Content yourselves with what you will as surely KEEP, and be not
restless, for you undertake a quiet journey to the
peace of God, where He would have you be in quietness.</p>

<p>In me you have already overcome EVERY temptation that would hold you
back. We walk together on the way to quietness that is the gift of God.
Hold me dear, for what except your brothers CAN you need? We will
restore to you the peace of mind that we must find TOGETHER. The Holy
Spirit will teach you to awaken unto us and to yourself. This is the
only REAL need to be fulfilled in time. Salvation FROM the world lies
only here. My peace I GIVE you. TAKE it of me in glad exchange for all
the world has offered but to take away. And we will spread it like a
veil of light across the world’s sad face, in which we hide our brothers
FROM the world, and it from them.</p>

<p>We cannot sing redemption’s hymn alone. My task is not completed until I
have lifted every voice with mine. And yet it is NOT mine, for as it is
my gift to you, so was it the Father’s gift to me, given me through His
Spirit. The sound of it will banish sorrow from the mind of God’s most
holy Son, where it cannot abide. Healing in time IS needed, for joy
cannot establish its eternal reign where sorrow dwells. You dwell not
here, but in eternity. You travel but in dreams while safe at home. Give
thanks to every part of you that you have taught how to REMEMBER you.
Thus does the Son of God give thanks unto his Father for his purity.</p>
