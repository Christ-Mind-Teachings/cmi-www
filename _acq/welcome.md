  Welcome to the Library of Christ Mind Teachings.
</h2>

The library is a collection of authoritative channeled insight and inspiration that offers a perspective on the individual and collective challenges of our lives and world that is not commonly taught. For many, this new perspective is immediately grasped as the only real solution to the problems of the world, from little annoyances to major conflict and from those of a personal nature to those that have global effect.

The books in the library express a similar message but each source presents it in a different way and often using somewhat different language. The content is the same, just the form differs. The variety of forms of teachings support a deeper understanding of the material.

The library is organized by teaching or *source* and each source contains one or more *books*. The [home page](/) displays an image that represents each source and a *Get Acquainted* guide. 

Since this is a new version of the Library the original edition is still available and represented by the first image on the page.

        <p>
        Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated A Course of Love to Mari Perron. Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Jesus describes ACOL as a "continuation" of A Course in Miracles. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart.

          <em>The Impersonal Life</em> was published in 1914 by Joepsh S. Benner. It is a teaching from a time much earlier than the other sources in the library and serves to illustrate the timeless nature of Christ Mind teachings.
