    <ol>
  <li>
    <p><sup>1</sup> There is no order of difficulty among miracles. One is not
“harder” or “bigger” than another. They are all the same. All
expressions of love are maximal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>2</sup> Miracles as such do not matter. The only thing that matters is
their Source, Which is far beyond human evaluation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>3</sup> Miracles occur naturally as expressions of love. The real miracle
is the love that inspires them. In this sense, everything that comes
from love is a miracle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>4</sup> All miracles mean life, and God is the Giver of life. His Voice
will direct you very specifically. You will be told all you need to
know.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>5</sup> Miracles are habits and should be involuntary. They should not be
under conscious control. Consciously selected miracles can be
misguided.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>6</sup> Miracles are natural. When they do <em>not</em> occur, something has gone wrong.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>7</sup> Miracles are everyone’s right, but purification is necessary first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>8</sup> Miracles are [a form of] healing. They supply a lack, and they are
performed by those who temporarily have more for those who
temporarily have less.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>9</sup> Miracles are a kind of exchange. Like all expressions of love,
which are <em>always</em> miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses
the physical laws. They bring <em>more</em> love both to the giver <em>and</em> the
receiver.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>10</sup> The use of miracles as spectacles to <em>induce</em> belief is wrong, or
better, is a misunderstanding of their purpose. They are really used
<em>for</em> and <em>by</em> believers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>11</sup> Prayer is the medium of miracles. Prayer is the natural
communication of the created with the Creator. Through prayer love
is received, and through miracles love is expressed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>12</sup> Miracles are thoughts. Thoughts can represent lower-order or
higher-order reality. This is the basic distinction between
intellectualizing and thinking. One makes the physical and the other
creates the spiritual, and we believe in what we make or create.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>13</sup> Miracles are both beginnings and endings. They thus alter the
temporal order. They are always affirmations of rebirth which seem
to go back but really go forward. They undo the past in the present
and thus release the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>14</sup> Miracles bear witness to truth. They are convincing because they
arise from conviction. Without conviction they deteriorate into
magic, which is mindless and therefore destructive, or rather the
uncreative use of mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>15</sup> Each day should be devoted to miracles. The purpose of time is to
enable man to learn to use it constructively. Time is thus a
teaching device and a means to an end. It will cease when it is no
longer useful in facilitating learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>16</sup> Miracles are teaching devices for demonstrating that it is more
blessed to give than to receive. They simultaneously increase the
strength of the giver and supply strength to the receiver.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>17</sup> Miracles are the transcendence of the body. They are sudden
shifts into invisibility, away from a sense of lower-order reality.
That is why they heal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>18</sup> A miracle is a service. It is the maximal service one individual
can render another. It is a way of loving your neighbor as yourself.
The doer recognizes his own and his neighbor’s inestimable worth
simultaneously.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>19</sup> [Miracles make Souls one in Christ.] They depend on cooperation
because the Sonship is the sum of all the Souls God created.
Miracles therefore rest on the laws of eternity, not of time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>20</sup> Miracles reawaken the awareness that the spirit, not the body, is
the altar of truth. This is the recognition that leads to the
healing power of the miracle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>21</sup> Miracles are natural expressions of total forgiveness. Through
miracles, man accepts God’s forgiveness by extending it to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>22</sup> Miracles are associated with fear only because of the fallacious
belief that darkness can <em>hide</em>. Man believes that what he cannot see
does not exist, and his physical eyes cannot see in the dark. This
is a very primitive solution and has led to a denial of the
Spiritual eye.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The escape from darkness involves two stages:</p>

    <p><sup>23</sup> A. The recognition that darkness cannot hide. This step usually entails fear.</p>

    <p><sup>24</sup> B. The recognition that there is nothing you <em>want</em> to hide, even
if you <em>could</em>. This step brings escape from fear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>25</sup> Miracles rearrange perception and place the levels of perception
in true perspective. This heals at <em>all</em> levels, because sickness
comes from confusing the levels.</p>

    <p><sup>26</sup> When you have become willing to hide nothing, you will not only
be willing to enter into communion but will also understand peace
and joy. Your commitment is not yet total, and that is why you still
have more to learn than to teach. When your equilibrium stabilizes,
you will be able to teach as much as you learn, which will give you
the proper balance. Meanwhile, remember that no effort is wasted,
for unless you remember this, you cannot avail yourselves of <em>my</em>
efforts, which <em>are</em> limitless. Only eternity is real. Why not use the
illusion of time constructively?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>27</sup> Miracles enable man to heal the sick and raise the dead, because
he made sickness and death himself and can abolish both. You are a
miracle, capable of creating in the likeness of your Creator.
Everything else is only your own nightmare and does not exist. Only
the creations of light are real.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>28</sup> Miracles are part of an interlocking chain of forgiveness which,
when completed, is the Atonement. This process works all the time
and in all the dimensions of time.</p>

    <p><sup>29</sup> I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to
begin. When you offer a miracle unto any of my brothers, you do it
unto <em>yourself</em> and me. The reason <em>you</em> come before <em>me</em> is that I do not
need miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case
you fail temporarily. The purpose of my part in the Atonement is the
canceling out of all lacks of love which men could not otherwise
correct. The word “sin” should be changed to “lack of love,” because
“sin” is a man-made word with threat connotations which he made up
himself. No <em>real</em> threat is involved anywhere. Nothing is gained by
frightening yourselves, and it is very destructive to do so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>30</sup> Miracles represent <em>freedom</em> from fear. “Atoning” really means
“undoing.” The undoing of fear is an essential part of the Atonement
value of miracles.</p>

    <p><sup>31</sup> The purpose of the Atonement is to restore <em>everything</em> to you, or
rather to restore it to your <em>awareness</em>. You were <em>given</em> everything when
you were created, just as everyone was. When you have been restored to
the recognition of your original state, you naturally become part of the
Atonement yourself. As you share <em>my</em> inability to tolerate lack of love
in yourself and others, you <em>must</em> join the Great Crusade to correct it.
The slogan for the Crusade is “Listen, learn and <em>do</em>”: Listen to my
voice, learn to undo error, and <em>do</em> something to correct it. The first
two are not enough. The real members of <em>my</em> party are <em>active</em> workers.</p>

    <p><sup>32</sup> The power to work miracles <em>belongs</em> to you. I will provide the
opportunities to do them, but <em>you</em> must be ready and willing since you
are already able. Doing them will bring conviction in the ability, since
conviction really comes through accomplishment. The ability is the
potential; the achievement is its expression; and the Atonement is the
purpose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>33</sup> A miracle is a universal blessing from God through me to <em>all</em> my
brothers. It is the privilege of the forgiven to forgive.</p>

    <p><sup>34</sup> The disciples were specifically told to be physicians of the Lord and
to heal others. They were also told to <em>heal themselves</em> and were promised
that I would never leave them or forsake them. Atonement is the natural
profession of the Children of God, because they have professed me.
“Heaven and earth shall pass away” simply means that they will not
continue to exist as separate states. My word, which is the resurrection
and the light, shall not pass away, because light is eternal. <em>You</em> are
the work of God, and His work is wholly lovable and wholly loving. This
is how a man <em>must</em> think of himself in his heart, because this is what he
<em>is</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>35</sup> Miracles are a means of organizing different levels of consciousness.</p>

    <p><sup>36</sup> Miracles come from the below or subconscious level. Revelations come
from the above or superconscious level. The conscious level is in
between and reacts to either sub- or superconscious impulses in varying
ratios. Consciousness is the level which engages in the world and is
capable of responding to both. Having no impulses from itself and being
primarily a mechanism for inducing response, it can be very wrong.</p>

    <p><sup>37</sup> Revelation induces complete but temporary suspension of doubt and
fear. It represents the original form of communication between God
and His Souls, involving an extremely personal sense of closeness to
creation which man tries to find in physical relationships. Physical
closeness <em>cannot</em> achieve this. The subconscious impulses properly
induce miracles, which are genuinely interpersonal and result in
real closeness to others. This can be misunderstood by a <em>personally</em>
willful consciousness as impulses toward physical gratification.</p>

    <p><sup>38</sup> Revelation unites Souls directly with God. Miracles unite [Souls]
directly with each other. Neither emanates from consciousness, but both
are <em>experienced</em> there. This is essential, because consciousness is the
state which produces action, though it does <em>not</em> inspire it. Man is free
to believe what he chooses, and what he <em>does</em> attests to what he
believes. The deeper levels of his subconscious <em>always</em> contain the
impulse to miracles, but he is free to fill its more superficial levels,
which are closer to consciousness, with the impulses of this world and
to identify himself with them. This results in <em>denying</em> himself access to
the miracle level underneath. In conscious actions, then, his
relationships also become superficial, and miracle-inspired relating
becomes impossible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>39</sup> Miracles are a way of <em>earning</em> release from fear.</p>

    <p><sup>40</sup> Revelation induces a state in which fear has <em>already</em> been abolished.
Miracles are thus a means, and revelation is an end. [In this sense,
they work together.] Miracles do not depend on revelation; they <em>induce</em>
it. Revelation is intensely personal and cannot actually be translated
into conscious content at all. That is why any attempt to describe it in
words is usually incomprehensible. Revelation induces <em>only</em> experience.
Miracles, on the other hand, induce [interpersonal] <em>action</em>. Miracles are
more useful now because of their [<em>impersonal</em>] nature. In this phase of
learning, working miracles is more important, because freedom from fear
cannot be thrust upon you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>41</sup> Miracles praise God through men. They praise God by honoring His
creations, affirming their perfection. They heal because they deny
body-identification and affirm Soul-identification. By perceiving
the spirit, they adjust the levels and see them in proper alignment.
This places the spirit at the center, where Souls can communicate
directly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>42</sup> Miracles should inspire gratitude, not awe. Man should thank God
for what he really is. The Children of God are very holy, and the
miracle honors their holiness.</p>

    <p><sup>43</sup> God’s creations never lose their holiness, although it can be
hidden.  The miracle uncovers it and brings it into the light where
it belongs.  Holiness can never be really hidden in darkness, but
man can deceive himself about it. This illusion makes him fearful,
because he knows in his heart it <em>is</em> an illusion, and he exerts
enormous efforts to establish its reality. The miracle sets reality
where it belongs. Eternal reality belongs only to the Soul, and the
miracle acknowledges only the truth. It thus dispels man’s illusions
about himself and puts him in communion with himself <em>and</em> God.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>44</sup> Christ inspires all miracles, which are really intercessions.
They intercede for man’s holiness and make his perceptions holy. By
placing him beyond the physical laws, they raise him into the sphere
of celestial order. In <em>this</em> order, man <em>is</em> perfect.</p>

    <p><sup>45</sup> The Soul never loses its communion with God. Only the mind needs
Atonement. The miracle joins in the Atonement of Christ by placing the
mind in the service of the spirit. This establishes the proper function
of the mind and corrects its errors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>46</sup> Miracles honor man because he is lovable. They dispel illusions
about him and perceive the light in him. They thus atone for his
errors by freeing him from his own nightmares. They release him from
a prison in which he has imprisoned <em>himself</em>, and by freeing his mind
from illusions, they restore his sanity. Man’s mind <em>can</em> be possessed
by illusions, but his spirit is eternally free. If a mind perceives
without love, it perceives an empty shell and is unaware of the
spirit within it. But the Atonement restores the Soul to its proper
place. The mind that serves the spirit is invulnerable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>47</sup> Miracles restore the [Soul] to its fullness. By atoning for lack,
they establish perfect protection. The strength of the Soul leaves
no room for intrusions. The forgiven are filled with the Soul, and
they forgive in return. It is the duty of the released to release
their brothers.</p>

    <p><sup>48</sup> The forgiven are the means of Atonement. Those released by Christ
must join in releasing their brothers, for this is the plan of the
Atonement. Miracles are the way in which minds which serve the spirit
unite with Christ for the salvation or release of all God’s creations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>49</sup> Miracles are expressions of love, but it does <em>not</em> follow that
they will always [be effective]. I am the only one who can perform
miracles indiscriminately, because I <em>am</em> the Atonement. You have a
<em>role</em> in the Atonement, which I will dictate <em>to</em> you. Ask <em>me</em> which
miracles you should perform. This spares you exhaustion, because you
will act under direct communication.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>50</sup> Christ-controlled miracles are part of the Atonement, but
Christ-guidance is personal [and leads to <em>personal</em> salvation]. The
impersonal nature of miracles is an essential ingredient, because
this enables me to control their distribution. Christ-guidance leads
to the highly <em>personal</em> experience of revelation. This is why it
involves <em>personal</em> choice. A guide does not control, but he <em>does</em>
direct, leaving the following up to you. “Lead us not into
temptation” means “guide us out of our own errors.” “Take up thy
cross and follow me” means, “Recognize your errors and choose to
abandon them by following my guidance.”</p>

    <p><sup>51</sup> Remember that error cannot really threaten truth, which can <em>always</em>
withstand it. <em>Only</em> the error is really vulnerable. You are free to
establish your kingdom where you see fit, but the right choice is
inevitable if you remember this:</p>

    <p><sup>52</sup> <em>The Soul is in a state of grace forever.<br />Man’s reality is
<strong>only</strong> his Soul.<br />Therefore, man is in a state of grace
forever.</em></p>

    <p><sup>53</sup> Atonement undoes all errors in this respect and thus uproots the <em>real</em>
source of fear. Whenever God’s reassurances are experienced as threat,
it is <em>always</em> because you are defending misplaced and misdirected
loyalty. That is what projection always involves. Error is lack of love.
When man projects this onto others, he <em>does</em> imprison them, but only to
the extent that he reinforces errors they have <em>already</em> made. This makes
them vulnerable to the distortions of others since their <em>own</em> perception
of themselves is distorted. The miracle worker can only <em>bless</em>, and this
undoes their distortions and frees them from prison.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>54</sup> Miracles are examples of right thinking. Reality contact at all
levels becomes strong and accurate, thus permitting correct
delineation of intra- and interpersonal boundaries. As a result, the
doer’s perceptions are aligned with truth as God created it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>55</sup> A miracle is a correction factor introduced into false thinking
by me. It acts as a catalyst, shaking up erroneous perception and
reorganizing it properly. This places man under the Atonement
principle, where his perception is healed. Until this has occurred,
revelation of the divine order is impossible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>56</sup> The Spiritual eye is the mechanism of miracles, because what It
perceives <em>is</em> true. It perceives both the creations of God and the
creations of man. Among the creations of man, it can also separate
the true from the false by Its ability to perceive totally rather
than selectively. It thus becomes the proper instrument for reality
testing, which always involves the necessary distinction between the
false and the true.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>57</sup> The miracle dissolves error, because the Spiritual eye identifies
error as false or unreal. This is the same as saying that by
perceiving light, darkness automatically disappears.</p>

    <p><sup>58</sup> Darkness is lack of light, as sin is lack of love. It has no unique
properties of its own. It is an example of the “scarcity” fallacy, from
which <em>only</em> error can proceed. Truth is always abundant. Those who
perceive and acknowledge that they have everything have no need for
driven behavior of <em>any</em> kind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>59</sup> The miracle acknowledges all men as your brothers and mine. It is
a way of perceiving the universal mark of God in them. The
specialness of God’s Sons does <em>not</em> stem from exclusion but from
inclusion. <em>All</em> my brothers are special. If they believe they are
deprived of anything, their perception becomes distorted. When this
occurs, the whole family of God, or the Sonship, is impaired in its
relationships. Ultimately, every member of the family of God must
return. The miracle calls him to return because it blesses and
honors him even though he may be absent in spirit.</p>

    <p><sup>60</sup> “God is not mocked” is not a warning but a reassurance on this point.
God <em>would</em> be mocked if any of His creations lacked holiness. The
creation <em>is</em> whole, and the mark of wholeness is holiness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>61</sup> Wholeness is the perceptual content of miracles. It thus corrects
or atones for the faulty perception of lack anywhere.</p>

    <p><sup>62</sup> Here we begin to make the fundamental distinction between miracles
and projection. The stimulus <em>must</em> precede the response and will also
determine the kind of response that is evoked. Behavior <em>is</em> response, so
that the question “response to what?” becomes crucial. Since stimuli are
identified through perception, you first perceive the stimulus and then
behave accordingly. It follows, then, that:</p>

    <p><sup>63</sup> <em>As ye perceive,<br />So shall ye behave.</em></p>

    <p><sup>64</sup> The Golden Rule asks you to behave toward others as you would have
them behave toward you. This means that the perception of both <em>must</em> be
accurate. The Golden Rule is the rule for appropriate behavior. You
cannot behave appropriately unless you perceive accurately, because
appropriate behavior <em>depends</em> on lack of level confusion. The presence of
level confusion <em>always</em> results in variable reality testing and therefore
in variability in behavioral appropriateness. Since you and your
neighbor are equal members of the same family, as you perceive both, so
you will behave toward both. The way to perceive for Golden Rule
behavior is to look out from the perception of your <em>own</em> holiness and
perceive the holiness of others.</p>

    <p><sup>65</sup> The emptiness engendered by fear should be replaced by love, because
love and its absence are in the same dimension, and correction cannot be
undertaken except <em>within</em> a dimension. Otherwise, there has been a
confusion of levels. Death is a human affirmation of a belief in
“[hate],” or level confusion. That is why the Bible says, “There <em>is</em> no
death” and why I demonstrated that death does not exist. I came to
fulfill the law by <em>reinterpreting</em> it. The law itself, if properly
understood, offers only protection to man. It is those who have not yet
“changed their minds” who entered the “hellfire” concept into it.</p>

    <p><sup>66</sup> I assure you that <em>I</em> will witness for anyone who lets me and to
whatever extent he permits it. <em>Your</em> witnessing demonstrates <em>your</em> belief
and thus strengthens it. Those who witness for me are expressing through
their miracles that they have abandoned the belief in deprivation in
favor of the abundance they have learned <em>belongs</em> to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>67</sup> A <em>major</em> contribution of miracles is their strength in releasing
man from his misplaced sense of isolation, deprivation, and lack.</p>

    <p><sup>68</sup> Miracles are affirmations of Sonship, which is a state of completion
and abundance. Whatever is true and real is eternal and <em>cannot</em> change or
<em>be</em> changed. The Soul is therefore unalterable because it is <em>already</em>
perfect, but the mind can elect the level it chooses to serve. The <em>only</em>
limit which is put on its choice is that it <em>cannot</em> serve two masters.</p>

    <p><sup>69</sup> The mind, if it elects to do so, becomes a medium by which the Soul
creates along the line of its own creation. If it does not freely elect
to do so, it retains its creative <em>potential</em> but places itself under
tyrannous rather than genuinely authoritative control. As a result it
imprisons, because such are the dictates of tyrants. To change your mind
means to place it at the disposal of <em>true</em> Authority.</p>

    <p><sup>70</sup> The miracle is thus a sign that the mind has chosen to be led by
Christ in His service. The abundance of Christ is the natural result of
choosing to follow Him. <em>All</em> shallow roots must be uprooted because they
are not deep enough to sustain you. The illusion that shallow roots can
be <em>deepened</em> and thus made to hold is one of the distortions on which the
<em>reversal</em> of the Golden Rule rests. As these false underpinnings are
given up, the equilibrium is temporarily experienced as unstable.
However, the fact is that <em>nothing</em> is less stable than an orientation
that is upside down. Nor can anything which holds it that way be really
conducive to greater stability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>71</sup> Miracles arise from a miraculous state of mind. By being one,
this state of mind goes out to <em>anyone</em>, even without the awareness of
the miracle worker himself. The impersonal nature of miracles is
because the Atonement itself is one, uniting all creations with
their Creator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>72</sup> The miracle is an expression of an inner awareness of Christ and
the acceptance of His Atonement. The mind is then in a state of
grace and naturally becomes gracious both to the host within and the
stranger without. By bringing in the stranger, he becomes your
brother.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>73</sup> A miracle is never lost. It touches many people you do not even
know and sometimes produces undreamed of changes in forces of which
you are not even aware. That is not your concern. The miracle will
always bless <em>you</em>.</p>

    <p><sup>74</sup> The miracles you are <em>not</em> asked to perform have not lost their value.
They are still expressions of your own state of grace, but the <em>action</em>
aspect of the miracle should be Christ-controlled because of His
complete awareness of the whole plan. The impersonal nature of
miracle-mindedness ensures <em>your</em> grace, but only Christ is in a position
to know where grace can be <em>bestowed</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>75</sup> Miracle-mindedness means miracle-readiness. Readiness means that
you should always keep your perceptions straight, so that you will
<em>always</em> be ready, willing, and able. These are the essentials for
“listen, learn, and do.” You must be <em>ready</em> to listen, <em>willing</em> to
learn, and <em>able</em> to do. Only the last is involuntary because it is
the <em>application</em> of miracles, which must be Christ-controlled. The
other two, which are the <em>voluntary</em> aspects of miracle-mindedness,
<em>are</em> up to you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>76</sup> Awe is an inappropriate response to miracles.</p>

    <p><sup>77</sup> Revelation is literally unspeakable because it is an experience of
unspeakable love. Awe should be reserved for revelation, to which it is
perfectly and correctly applicable. It is <em>not</em> appropriate for miracles,
because a state of awe is worshipful. It implies that one of a lesser
order stands before a greater one. This is the case <em>only</em> when a Soul
stands before its Creator. Souls are perfect creations and experience
awe only in the Presence of the Creator of perfection.</p>

    <p><sup>78</sup> The miracle, on the other hand, is a sign of love among equals.
Equals cannot be in awe of one another because awe implies
inequality.  It is therefore an inappropriate reaction to me. An
elder brother is entitled to respect for his greater experience and
a reasonable amount of obedience for his greater wisdom. He is also
entitled to love because he <em>is</em> a brother and also to devotion if he
is devoted. It is only my devotion that entitles me to yours. There
is nothing about me that <em>you</em> cannot attain. I have nothing that does
not come from God. The main difference between us as yet is that I
have <em>nothing</em> else. This leaves me in a state of true holiness, which
is only a <em>potential</em> in you.</p>

    <p><sup>79</sup> “No man cometh unto the Father but by me” is among the most
misunderstood statements in the Bible. It does <em>not</em> mean that I am in any
way separate or different from you <em>except in time</em>, which does not really
exist at all. Actually, the quotation is more meaningful if it is
considered on a vertical rather than a horizontal axis. Regarded along
the vertical, man stands below me and I stand below God. In the process
of “rising up,” I <em>am</em> higher. This is because, without me, the distance
between God and man would be too great for you to encompass.</p>

    <p><sup>80</sup> I bridge the distance as an elder brother to man on the one hand and
as a Son of God on the other. My devotion to my brothers has placed me
in charge of the Sonship, which I can render complete only to the extent
to which I can <em>share</em> it. This may appear to contradict the statement, “I
and my Father are one,” but there are still separate parts in the
statement in recognition that the Father is greater. (The original
statement was “are of one kind”). The Holy Spirit is the bringer of
revelations. Revelations are <em>indirectly</em> inspired by me because I am
close to the Holy Spirit and alert to the revelation-readiness of my
brothers. I can thus <em>bring</em> down to them more than they can <em>draw</em> down to
themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>81</sup> The Holy Spirit is the highest communication medium. Miracles do
not involve this type of communication, because they are <em>temporary</em>
communication devices. When man returns to his original form of
communication with God, the need for miracles is over. The Holy
Spirit mediates higher to lower communication, keeping the direct
channel from God to man open for revelation. Revelation is not
reciprocal. It is always <em>from</em> God <em>to</em> man. The miracle <em>is</em> reciprocal
because it involves equality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>82</sup> The miracle is a learning device which lessens the need for time.
In the longitudinal or horizontal plane, the recognition of the true
equality of all the members of the Sonship appears to involve almost
endless time. However, the sudden shift from horizontal to vertical
perception which the miracle entails introduces an interval from
which the doer and the receiver both emerge much farther along in
time than they would otherwise have been.</p>

    <p><sup>83</sup> The miracle thus has the unique property of shortening time by
rendering the space of time it occupies unnecessary. There is <em>no</em>
relationship between the time a miracle <em>takes</em> and the time it
<em>covers</em>. It substitutes for learning that might have taken thousands
of years. It does this by the underlying recognition of perfect
equality and holiness between the doer and the receiver on which the
miracle rests.</p>

    <p><sup>84</sup> We said before that the miracle abolishes time. It does this by a
process of <em>collapsing</em> it and thus abolishing certain <em>intervals</em> within
it. It does this, however, <em>within</em> the larger temporal sequence. It
establishes an out-of-pattern time interval which is <em>not</em> under the usual
laws of time. Only in this sense is it timeless. By collapsing time, it
literally saves time. Much as daylight saving time does, it rearranges
the distribution of light.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>85</sup> The miracle is the only device which man has at his immediate
disposal for controlling time. Only revelation <em>transcends</em> time,
having nothing to do with time at all.</p>

    <p><sup>86</sup> The miracle is much like the body in that both are learning aids
which aim at facilitating a state in which they are unnecessary. When
the Soul’s original state of direct communication is reached, neither
the body nor the miracle serves any purpose. While he believes he is in
a body, however, man can choose between loveless and miraculous channels
of expression. He can make an empty shell, but he <em>cannot</em> express nothing
at all. He can wait, delay, paralyze himself, reduce his creativity to
almost nothing, and even introduce a developmental arrest or even a
regression. But he <em>cannot</em> abolish his creativity. He can destroy his
medium of communication but <em>not</em> his potential.</p>

    <p><sup>87</sup> Man was <em>not</em> created by his own free will alone. Only what <em>he</em> creates
is his to decide. The basic decision of the miracle-minded is not to
wait on time any longer than is necessary. Time can waste as well as be
wasted. The miracle-worker, therefore, accepts the time-control factor
gladly because he recognizes that every collapse of time brings all men
closer to the ultimate <em>release</em> from time in which the Son and the Father
<em>are</em> one.</p>

    <p><sup>88</sup> Equality does not imply homogeneity <em>now</em>. When everyone recognizes
that he has everything, individual contributions to the Sonship will no
longer be necessary. When the Atonement has been completed, <em>all</em> talents
will be shared by <em>all</em> the Sons of God. God is <em>not</em> partial. All His
Children have His total love, and <em>all</em> His gifts are freely given to
everyone alike. “Except ye become as little children” means that, unless
you fully recognize your complete dependence on God, you cannot know the
real power of the Son in his true relationship with the Father.</p>

    <p><sup>89</sup> You who want peace can find it only by complete forgiveness. You
never really <em>wanted</em> peace before, so there was no point in being
told how to achieve it. No learning is acquired by anyone unless he
wants to learn it and believes in some way that he <em>needs</em> it. While
the concept of lack does not exist in the creation of God, it is
<em>very</em> apparent in the creations of man. It is, in fact, the essential
difference. A need implies lack by definition. It involves the
recognition that you would be better off in a state which is somehow
different from the one you are in.</p>

    <p><sup>90</sup> Until the “separation,” which is a better term than the “fall,”
nothing was lacking. This meant that man had no needs at all. If he had
not deprived himself, he would never have experienced them. After the
separation, needs became the most powerful source of motivation for
human action. All behavior is essentially motivated by needs, but
behavior itself is not a divine attribute. The body is the mechanism for
behavior. The belief that he <em>could</em> be better off is the reason why man
has this mechanism at his disposal.</p>

    <p><sup>91</sup> Each one acts according to the particular hierarchy of needs he
establishes for himself. His hierarchy, in turn, depends on his
perception of what he <em>is</em>—that is, what he <em>lacks</em>. A sense of separation
from God is the only <em>lack</em> he really needs to correct. This sense of
separation would never have occurred if he had not distorted his
perception of truth and thus perceived <em>himself</em> as lacking. The concept
of <em>any</em> sort of need hierarchy arose because, having made this
fundamental error, he had already fragmented himself into levels with
different needs. As he integrates <em>he</em> becomes one, and his needs become
one accordingly.</p>

    <p><sup>92</sup> Unified need produces unified action, because it produces a lack of
ambivalence. The concept of a need hierarchy, a corollary to the
original error that man can be separated from God, requires correction
at its own level before the error of perceiving levels at all can be
corrected. Man cannot behave effectively while he operates at split
levels. However, while he does, correction must be introduced from the
bottom <em>up</em>. This is because he now operates in space, where concepts such
as “up” and “down” are meaningful. Ultimately, space is as meaningless
as time. The concept is really one of space-time <em>belief</em>.</p>

    <p><sup>93</sup> The physical world exists only because man can use it to correct his
<em>unbelief</em>, which placed him in it originally. He can never control the
effects of fear himself because he <em>made</em> fear and believes in what he
made. In attitude, then, though <em>not</em> in content, he resembles his own
Creator, Who has perfect faith in His creations <em>because</em> He created them.
Belief in a creation produces its existence. That is why a man can
believe in what no one else thinks is true. It is true for him because
it was made <em>by</em> him.</p>

    <p><sup>94</sup> Every aspect of fear proceeds from upside-down perception. The
more truly creative devote their efforts to correcting perceptual
distortions. The neurotic devotes his to compromise. The psychotic
tries to escape by establishing the certain truth of his own errors.
It is most difficult to free him by ordinary means because he is
more consistent in his own denial of truth. The miracle, however,
makes no such distinctions. It corrects errors because they are
errors. Thus, the next point to remember about miracles is:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>95</sup> The miracle makes no distinction among degrees of misperception.
It is a device for perception-correction, effective quite apart from
either the degree or the direction of the error. This is its <em>true</em>
indiscriminateness.</p>

    <p><sup>96</sup> Christ-controlled miracles are selective <em>only</em> in the sense that they
are directed towards those who can use them for <em>themselves</em>. Since this
makes it inevitable that they will extend them to others, a strong chain
of Atonement is welded. However, Christ-control takes no account at all
of the magnitude of the miracle itself because the concept of size
exists in a plane that is itself unreal. Since the miracle aims at
<em>restoring</em> the awareness of reality, it would hardly be useful if it were
bound by the laws which govern the error it aims to correct. Only man
makes this kind of mistake. It is an example of the foolish consistency
which his own false beliefs have engendered.</p>

    <p><sup>97</sup> The power and strength of man’s creative will must be understood
before the real meaning of denial can be appreciated and relinquished.
It is <em>not</em> mere negation. It is a positive miscreation. While the
miscreation is <em>necessarily</em> believed in by its maker, it does not exist
at all at the level of true creation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>98</sup> The miracle compares what man has made with the higher level
creation, accepting what is <em>in accord</em> as true and rejecting the
<em>discordant</em> as false. <em>All</em> aspects of fear are untrue because they do
not exist at the higher creative level, and therefore do not exist
at all. To whatever extent a man is willing to submit his beliefs to
this test, to that extent are perceptions corrected.</p>

    <p><sup>99</sup> In sorting out the false from the true, the miracle proceeds along
the following lines:</p>

    <p><sup>100</sup> <em>If perfect love casts out fear,<br />And if fear
exists,<br />Then there is <strong>not</strong> perfect love.<br />But only perfect
love <strong>really</strong> exists.<br />If there <strong>is</strong> fear,<br />It creates a
state which does not exist.</em></p>

    <p><sup>101</sup> Believe this and you <em>will</em> be free. Only God can establish this
solution, and <em>this</em> faith <em>is</em> His gift.</p>
