    <p>4.1 This Covenant is the fulfillment of the agreement between you and
God. The agreement is for you to be the new. As you are new, so too is
God, for you are one, if not the same. As you are new, so too is the
world, for you are one, if not the same. As you are new, so are your
brothers and sisters, for they, too, are one, if not the same.</p>

<p>4.2 While not the same, you also are not different. The differences you
saw during the time of learning, differences that made you feel as if
each being stood separate and alone, you are now called to see no more.
In unity you are whole and inseparable, one living organism now raised
above the level of the organism as you become aware of unity of form.</p>

<p>4.3 It is time now for this idea to be accepted, for if it is not, you
will remain in the prison you have created.</p>

<p>4.4 Prison is an excellent example of a system you created with your
faulty perception. As with all systems, it reflects an inward state and
shows you what becomes of all of those who see not what it means to be
neither different nor the same but to be one.</p>

<p>4.5 For the moment, disregard any idea you may have of there being those
who deserve the prison system you have developed and any arguments you
would cite about the heinous crimes of some. Think instead of prison
simply becoming a way of life for those who are incarcerated there. Each
of you has had an imprisoned personal self. Each of you who have entered
Christ-consciousness has had the cell door and the prison gate thrown
open and a new world offered. If you do not “accept” this opportunity,
you remain incarcerated in a system that tells you when you will awaken,
how you will spend your day and when you will retire. You remain at the
mercy of those who are incarcerated along with you. You remain at the
mercy of those who would have power over you, and you remain subject to
the laws of man.</p>

<p>4.6 I tell you truthfully that until you are living as who you are and
are doing what you love, you are in prison. This prison is as much of
your own making as are the actual prison systems that developed when
shape and form was given to what you fear and what you believe will
protect you.</p>

<p>4.7 Just as an actual prisoner, when released from prison, must adjust
to a life in which his or her actions are no longer restricted
artificially, you must adjust to your new freedom. Your life has been
artificially restricted by the prison you have created of it, and the
actual prison system merely mirrors this restriction on a grand scale
for all to see and look upon with dread. For most, the prison system is
a very successful deterrent. The thought of time in prison fills the
mind with fear. And yet those who are imprisoned often become so
acclimated to prison life, that life on the “outside” is no longer seen
as desirable. How can this be?</p>

<p>4.8 A life of artificial structure is all any of you have known. An
internally structured life will quickly replace the life of the inmate
if you will but let it do so. Even those who actually are incarcerated
in the prison system you have made are free to follow an internally
structured life to a greater extent than many of those who call
themselves free.</p>

<p>4.9 Your prison was created by the separated thoughts of the separated
thought “system.” Systems, as you may recall, are the result of your
attempts to externalize the patterns contained within. Patterns are both
of learning and of design.</p>

<p>4.10 Let’s look at each of these terms separately so that we see the
nature of existence in the same way and speak the same language while
discussing it.</p>

<p>4.11 Let us begin by coming to agreement about the idea of divine
design. This divine design could also be called creation, and where we
have spoken of creation previously, divine design was also spoken of.
Here I am quite confident that you have either seen and learned enough
during your time as a learning being that you accept that a divine
design created the universe and all that is in it, or that you trust
enough in the wisdom of your heart, that you know that this is so.
Either way, you may still believe in a divine design without accepting
that a divine design exists and that you are part of it. Remember that
our goal here is to deny the old and accept the new. In this case, the
old you would deny is the idea of a purposeless existence, a universe
with no divine order, a life in which you are at the mercy of fate. The
new idea you are asked to accept is that existence is purposeful, that
the universe exists in divine order, and that your life is part of that
divine design.</p>

<p>4.12 Divine patterns are the patterns that made your existence in form
possible as well as the patterns that have made your return to your true
identity possible. These patterns are both external and internal.
External divine patterns include the observable forms that make up your
world, everything from the planet on which you exist to the stars in the
sky, from the body you seem to inhabit to the animal and plant life that
exists around you. From the daintiest and most intricately laced
snowflake to the stem of a plant to the workings of the human brain, a
divine pattern is evident and should not be beyond your belief. Despite
the differences in what you see, think, and feel, there is but one
external divine pattern that created the observable world, and only one
internal divine pattern that created the internal world. The internal
divine pattern was that of learning.</p>

<p>4.13 The two patterns, the internal and the external, were created
together to exist in a complementary fashion. Both of these divine
patterns are being newly recreated and we will talk much more of them
and of the creative time we are now entering. Thus far, we are merely
working together to create a pattern of acceptance to replace the
pattern of learning.</p>

<p>4.14 Systems of thought are both divinely inspired and products of the
separated self. The idea of giving and receiving as one might be thought
of as a divinely inspired system of thought. In such a way of thinking,
one would take the internal thought pattern, enhance it with the
external pattern, and by seeing the unity and cooperation of all,
understand and live according to the system of thought of giving and
receiving being one. Systems of thought are thus the foundation upon
which how you live arises. The truth is a system of thought. It exists
in wholeness and has always been available.</p>

<p>4.15 Systems of thought that arose from the separated self are those you
have accepted as the truth. Some of these systems of thought were part
of the divine pattern. Contrast is one such system. As a learning being,
you accepted that you learned through contrast, knowing that contrast
was provided for your learning. It was upon the foundation of this and
other thought systems that your perception developed. Through contrast,
you identified and classified the world around you based upon the
differences, or contrast that you saw.</p>

<p>4.16 Other systems of thought were not part of the divine pattern. The
ego is one such system. It may seem peculiar to think of the ego as a
system, and we have heretofore referred to both the ego and to the ego’s
thought system, but the ego is quite rightly seen as a system in and of
itself. It is thought externalized and given an identity you but falsely
believed to be yourself. From this one externalized thought pattern came
most of your false ideas, ideas that made it difficult even for the
divinely inspired thought systems to provide the learning they were
designed to impart. Such is the case with the system of learning through
contrast, since when the ego entered with its false ideas and judgment,
contrast did not always provide the lessons it was meant to provide. In
addition, believing the ego had become an externalized self took you,
the true Self and the true learner, out of the learning loop. Obviously
these systems, built as they were upon patterns now being recreated, are
part of the old.</p>

<p>4.17 Externalized patterns, or systems, were also built from the systems
of thought that have been your foundation, the basic building blocks of
what you have seen as reality. As such, these systems too are obviously
of the old.</p>

<p>4.18 Just as obviously, all we are left with is divine design. All we
are left with is what was given: A divine universe, a divine existence.
That divine universe, our divine existence, is now recreating the
patterns that served the time of learning. What was learned in the
instant in which you came to know your Self is all that learning was
for. Let us not dwell any longer on why this has taken so long or on the
suffering that occurred during the time of learning. This would be like
dwelling on the inmate’s life as an inmate once he has been freed. Let
us simply create a new structure around the new pattern of acceptance, a
structure that will provide you with the home on Earth you have so long
sought and used your faulty systems to but attempt to replicate.</p>

<p>4.19 I speak of structure here not as a thing—not as a building in which
to dwell or as a set of rules or instructions to follow in order to
build the new—but as structure that will provide you with parameters in
which to begin to experience your new freedom. It is your questions and
concerns that have led me to speak of such, for it is you who have felt
such as this is needed. The unlimited freedom offered you is too vast
for your comfort. Thus without limiting this freedom at all, let us
simply speak of a place and a way to begin to experience it, and of a
place and a way to begin to create the new.  4.20 This place and this
way begins at the prison doors, begins, as we said earlier, with
acceptance of the new and denial of the old. Turn your back on the
prison of your former existence and do not look at it again. Do not long
for its old structure or the false security you came to feel at times
within it. Do not look for a new structure with barred windows and doors
to keep you safe. Do not seek someone to tell you anew what to do with
who you are now that you are no longer a prisoner. Do not give keys to a
new jailer and ask to be taken care of in exchange for your newfound
freedom.</p>

<p>4.21 Instead see the world anew and rejoice in it, just as you would
have had you literally spent your life within a prison’s walls. Breathe
the sweet air of freedom. Be aware constantly of the sky above your head
and desire no more ceilings to shield you from it.</p>

<p>4.22 Beware of gifts offered in exchange for your newfound freedom. A
hungry ex-prisoner may soon come to feel the three meals a day provided
in the prison were gifts indeed. So too are the gifts many of you have
desired and still feel as if you need. If you have imprisoned yourself
in order to earn a living by doing work that brings you no joy and
allows you not to be who you are, then you are called to walk away. If
you are tempted by a relationship in which you cannot be fully yourself
because of the security it will provide, you are but tempted by a false
security, and are called to turn away. If you are lured away from who
you are by a drive to succeed, if you fear doing what you want to do
because you might fail, if you follow another’s path and seek not your
own, then you have imprisoned yourself for the “three meals a day” of
the old way.</p>

<p>4.23 What has this to do with structure and parameters? Everything. You
cannot deny the old and remain in the prison of the old. You have asked,
and because you have asked I am telling you, that the permission you
seek must come from your own heart and from your commitment to the
Covenant of the New. Once again I remind you that there is no authority
to whom you can turn. But in place of that “outside” authority, I give
you your own authority, an authority you must claim in order for it to
be your own. An authority you must claim before your externally
structured life can become an internally structured life.</p>

<p>4.24 Let this acceptance of your own internal authority be your first
“act” of acceptance rather than learning. Turn to this as the new
pattern and to the thought system of giving and receiving as one. Let
the authority of the new be given and received. Become the author of
your own life. Live it as you feel called to live it.</p>

<p>4.25 We cannot build the new upon prison walls of old. Whatever
imprisons you must now be left behind.</p>

<p>4.26 Those of you now protesting having heard what you have so longed to
hear, protest no more. You cannot keep your prison and have the new life
that you long to have. You may have to examine just what it is that
imprisons you. You may find that it is attitude more so than
circumstance, or you may feel as if the walls that imprison you are so
sturdy and so long barred that they may as well be prison walls. You may
even be a prisoner in truth, and wonder how, save a grand escape, you
can proceed. But I tell you truthfully, your release is at hand and it
will come from your own authority and no place else. It is up to you to
accept that your release is possible, to desire it without fear, to call
it into being.</p>

<p>4.27 Do you not see that you must begin with yourself? That if you are
unwilling to claim your freedom it will not claim you?</p>

<p>4.28 What is one, or in union with all, draws from the well of divine
design. You need not turn to old patterns or systems to accomplish your
release. You can only turn to what is, to what is left now that the
patterns and systems of learning are no longer.</p>

<p>4.29 You accept that what has been given is available. You accept and
you receive. You realize that the first order of creation of the new is
restoration of the original order, or original design. As you have been
returned to your Self, now your life must be returned to where it fits
within the divine design, to where it is a life of meaning and purpose.
This return is the return of wholeness. This return is not selfish on
your part, but magnanimous. It returns wholeness to you and wholeness to
the divine design. It returns creation to what it is.</p>

<p>4.30 Understand—this cannot be fearful. This cannot fail. This will not
bring suffering but will end suffering. Your part is to invite it and
accept it when it comes. State your willingness, accept the coming of
your release, and prepare to leave your prison behind. Invite this
simply by inviting what brings you joy. Invite yourself first to this
new world, but leave not your brothers and sisters behind. Invite them
too. For those who are imprisoned are one with you, and need but your
release to find their own.</p>

<p>4.31 Dear brothers and sisters in Christ, I hear your protests and the
reasons that you feel must prevent you from the acceptance I call you
to. Yet as you fully accept that your right to your inheritance, your
right to be who you are, and your commitment to the Covenant of the New,
are one and the same, these reasons will disappear. All the different
reasons you would cite become what they are—one reason, the same
reason—and you will see that what is one is neither the same nor
different. You will see that there is one answer, an answer different
for everyone and yet the same for everyone. That answer is acceptance of
your Self. That answer is acceptance of the new you.</p>
