  December 16, 1988
</p>

<p><span class="capital">T</span>here have been times during the past
several months when I have felt very clear about not only this book, but
about Jeshua. During those times, I cannot help but give thanks; rather
than commuting on congested highways, my time is spent enjoying the
peace and quiet of my home, allowing the manuscript to take shape around
the communications from Jeshua.</p>

<p>But there are other times - of anxiety, of questioning, of doubt -and I
am convinced that surely this must be crazy. Well, almost convinced.</p>

<p>Always, when the tirade of self-criticism abates, there comes a quiet
voice speaking to me, heard only when I choose stillness within. He is
there, always, assuring me that all is as it needs to be, reminding me
that my task is to trust.</p>

<p>Last week, during one of my anxiety attacks about small details like
paying the rent and buying food, I put the thought out to the universe
that I just can’t do this, that I am, after all, not very good at
jumping off cliffs! Isn’t there a nice, comfortable job out there? The
very next morning the phone rang, and I answered it to receive an offer
for just that! My first impulse - probably out of habit - was to grab it
fast, before the lifeline was withdrawn. But something made me stop. I
made an excuse about needing time to think about it.</p>

<p>I tried to spend the day just tinkering around the apartment, but grew
restless and took a long walk. It is not often that December provides
such a pleasant and dry opportunity in the Northwest. I ended up on a
bench at a deserted pier along Ruston Way, watching a sea otter lazily
playing in the water twenty yards away.</p>

<p>I feel caught between two worlds, knowing that I am unable, or
unwilling, to return to the old world, yet only faintly recognizing the
one ahead. It is a world without familiar roadmaps and signposts, a
world which I am hesitant to enter. But behind my internal, intellectual
hairpulling is a feeling, a sense that somehow, in some way, I am going
to emerge there, where He is, wherever that is, and in spite of myself.</p>

<p>I know well now, after this year and a half with Jeshua, what is
required of me, <em>if</em> I truly want to be in what He calls the “Kingdom.” It
means giving up all the familiar ways I have cultivated for dealing with
life, or what I <em>thought</em> was life. Whether those ways are effective or
not is beside the point. It means releasing the unconscious belief that
my life is <em>mine</em>, in the common view we all have of “me”. Habits are not
easily broken, or is it that “I” <em>can’t</em> break it, since “I” <em>am</em>,
fundamentally, the habit?</p>

<p>As I watched the sea otter comfortably swimming about just off the end
of the pier, I began to think that maybe those crazy physicists working
on the cutting edge of quantum theory are close to the truth, closer
than perhaps they realize. Or are they masters come to us in disguise to
prod us out of the structures of our thoughts, the shadows on our cave
walls? They speak of an odd reality, in which all possibilities are
somehow already present, hidden in some invisible bag of eternity,
waiting - waiting for us to do but one thing: to make a choice as to
which “reality” we will manifest. We are the ones with the power after
all, always.</p>

<p>According to Jeshua, those “infinite possibilities” come wrapped in two
packages: one is labeled the “Kingdom,” and the other, “Dream”. The
Dream holds within it a seemingly infinite number of possibilities: all
the worlds and lifetimes lived before us, lived after us, lived now as
us. All of these worlds are founded on one cornerstone: Separation,
inseparably united with one fundamental energy, the energy of fear.
Collectively, we believe so strongly in it that it goes unquestioned. We
live in separation from each other, from nature, from God. Because we
insist on being separate, we choose without hesitation the package
labeled “Dream,” and immediately find ourselves right here, right now,
in a world we have believed to be real and independent of us. Or is it
but a mirror reflecting nothing but our choice?</p>

<p>“Maybe,” I thought to myself, “maybe the world keeps revolving round as
it does, wars and greed and the like, because we insist it is real, and
then struggle to find ways to deal with it. Have we given the package
labeled ‘Dream’ our power? Have we given the very power of the Son away
to our illusions?”</p>

<p>In Tibetan Buddhist metaphysics, it is said that at death the soul
leaves the body and begins ascending to the clear light of the
Dharmakaya, the “Body of Truth.” However, faced with the overwhelming
power and beauty of this light, the soul - habitually identified with
its sense of being a separate self - recoils out of fear. This recoil
creates a heaviness, and the soul sinks down, eventually back into yet
another round of birth and death in a physical body, and all because the
soul misunderstands its own nature, insisting on being separate!</p>

<p>Perhaps the packages aren’t offered only once. Perhaps they are offered
to us every morning as we wake up, or every moment, for that matter. Is
the Light always available, and the death we fear but a moment’s
delusion?</p>

<p>Perhaps if we all decide to choose anew, right here wherever we are,
right now whatever we are, the world we will manifest will be different,
so very different. Different because we will seek not to create our
world, but the world intended by a mystery forever beyond us, yet a
mystery that resides right in our very core, at the center of our own
truest selves.</p>

<p>The sea otter disappeared beneath the surface of the bay, swimming off
to explore and play in other worlds. I waited for a moment, hoping he
would surface again, then turned and walked home.</p>

<p>Back in my apartment, I stared at my computer, unable to find anything
to say, not sure what the direction of this book is to be. It is still
ahead of me, somewhere in that fog, the one without any signposts.</p>

<p>I spent the evening watching television, that great god of culture
forever reassuring us of what is real. Finally, I pointed the remote
control at the picture of some newscaster - they all look and sound the
same, don’t they? - and zap! The world disappeared!</p>

<p>It seems so clear, so simple! And yet a trace of something inside me is
still resisting. Separation, and all that comes with it - where is the
button, and how do I push it? How do I change channels? How do I finally
and irrevocably release the package labeled “Dream”? Am I sure I want
to?</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Marc, arise and write, please.</p>

<p>The voice startles me, and my eyes pop open.</p>

<p>“Ohhh, damn.” I lift my head with a struggle and turn to look at the
clock. It is 11:30, and I feel very tired.</p>

<p>“Can’t we do this in the morning?” I ask my unseen visitor, then chuckle
to myself at the nonchalance with which this conversation is taking
place.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes.</p>

<p>God, I love the feeling of His presence so much, and think how nice it
would be to just curl up on His “lap” and sleep forever.</p>

<p class="indent">At three o’clock, you will be awakened, and we shall continue.</p>

<p>Three o’clock! I was thinking more along the lines of nine o’clock, or
even later. I feel his energy subside, and quickly fall back asleep.</p>

<p>Out of a myriad of cascading thoughts and images, awareness emerges. I
realize I am awake.</p>

<p>“Damn, damn, double damn!” I sink down in the covers. It is so nice and
warm here, and so cold out there! I know, I’ll just ignore this. Giving
it everything I can, I toss restlessly for awhile.</p>

<p>Suddenly, my eyes pop wide open. Looking out of the corner of my eyes, I
see the clock clearly. It is 3:34, and I have to go to the bathroom. No
warning at all, I just have to go to the bathroom, and it won’t wait
another minute.</p>

<p>Disgustedly, I throw the covers back and grab my robe. On the way to the
bathroom I lift my eyes upward, muttering under my breath, “Boy, you
guys will stop at nothing, will you?”</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>Now, we begin.</p>

  <p>You are losing the battle, Marc.<br />
Losing,<br />
but loss is not our aim now.<br />
Soon,<br />
there comes a clear sign unto you<br />
of the work in which you participate,<br />
the work of the Son’s atonement.</p>

  <p>When you clearly choose<br />
the active participation in this work,<br />
there will be <strong>nothing</strong><br />
which will not be provided.</p>

  <p>There is no need to return<br />
to your former dreams,<br />
and is this thought<br />
not the reason for your apparent misery?</p>

  <p>Now is the time<br />
of your final choice upon you.<br />
The choice is but<br />
between Love, and fear.<br />
Fear is your habit,<br />
the Dream of humanity,<br />
and the denial<br />
of the Son’s rightful inheritance.</p>

  <p>It is an inheritance,<br />
the acceptance of which,<br />
is a choice which must be made alone,<br />
only because it was once alone denied.</p>

  <p>There is no effort<br />
experienced in the Kingdom.<br />
There is only the manifestation<br />
of the Father’s will for you<br />
and through you -<br />
a demonstration that touches<br />
the sleeping soul of the Son<br />
cloaked momentarily in a dream of aloneness,<br />
stumbling through fields<br />
strewn with the corpses of death,<br />
and that which is even now dying.<br />
For Separation from the Father<br />
is death,<br />
and nothing more.</p>

  <p>When you choose<br />
the abundance of the Kingdom,<br />
there is born a way of living<br />
which requires no planning,<br />
no achievement,<br />
no securing of one’s survival.<br />
All is prepared before you,<br />
the one who serves first<br />
the Father who is within you.</p>

  <p>Awakening from the Dream<br />
seems painful<br />
only to the degree<br />
that one resists arising from<br />
the temptation of illusory sleep,<br />
and the apparent need of it.<br />
This sleep is but the habit,<br />
cultivated since the choice was made,<br />
to inhere in the Dream of Separation.</p>

  <p>Would you not choose with Me<br />
the Reality of the Kingdom?<br />
In it is all you can ever imagine,<br />
every need fulfilled<br />
before even a single request is made.<br />
For surely your Father knows<br />
you have need of these things.</p>

  <p>You have experienced<br />
the many aspects of Separation.<br />
This world you know well.<br />
Has its allure<br />
not clearly failed you?<br />
Choose, then,<br />
only to release your<br />
useless dream,<br />
and be born again<br />
into the experience of the Kingdom.<br />
This choice gives birth<br />
to a process of recognition<br />
that quickly re-establishes remembrance<br />
of the Son’s rightful place.<br />
For you will sit<br />
at the right hand of the Father,<br />
reviewing naught<br />
but the splendor of a magnificence<br />
unimaginable within the paltry,<br />
and painful,<br />
Dream of Separation.</p>

  <p>The dream of fear,<br />
which is all of mankind’s worlds,<br />
contains not a trace<br />
of true joy,<br />
only of apparent pleasures<br />
lasting but an instant.</p>

  <p>Choose, therefore,<br />
That which is everlasting.<br />
Choose therefore<br />
That which abides forever,<br />
and whose boundaries<br />
are never reached.<br />
Choose, therefore,<br />
the presence of the Father<br />
within you,<br />
and the Kingdom<br />
is all you will experience around you.</p>

  <p>What life could be lighter<br />
than one requiring<br />
not a trace of struggle?<br />
What joy could surpass participation<br />
in the eternal abundance<br />
which is the presence of the Father,<br />
and the awakening of the Son,<br />
in everyone<br />
living the dreadful Dream<br />
you have for so long suffered?</p>

  <p>We love you greatly.<br />
Yet we cannot choose for you.<br />
We merely guide you,<br />
pointing the way<br />
only when asked,<br />
patiently awaiting recognition<br />
of the Dream<br />
to dawn in the consciousness<br />
of a mind habituated to shadows,<br />
a recognition<br />
of the Dream’s depravity.</p>

  <p>Choose the Kingdom wholly,<br />
and the Dream shall be no more.<br />
It vanishes from the mind forever,<br />
leaving only incredible peace,<br />
and wonder that the Dream<br />
could have ever been dreamt.</p>

  <p>There is no lack in the Kingdom.<br /></p>

  <p>Your only task -<br />
if we may call it that -<br />
is to experience in joy<br />
the absolute safety and abundance<br />
of the Father’s table.</p>

  <p>This simple choice<br />
demonstrates a truth,<br />
buried deeply in the heart<br />
of every son yet sleeping.<br />
To witness this choice<br />
is the act of being nudged into waking,<br />
until all the sons of man<br />
are again living as<br />
the Truth they are:<br />
the one Son,<br />
begotten of the Father<br />
before all worlds,<br />
partaking in the abundance<br />
freely given,<br />
the presence of the Father.</p>

  <p>Herein lies<br />
the Kingdom<br />
of heaven on earth.<br />
Can there be,<br />
in truth,<br />
any choice but this?</p>

</div>

<p>For a moment, I pause. The energy which is Jeshua has suddenly abated,
and I find myself gazing at the flickering lights on the black and quiet
waters of the harbor. There is the faintest of feelings within me, a
pulsing of some sort. Surrendering my resistance, I breathe deeply and
slowly, allowing abdomen, ribs, and chest to expand and release without
strain.</p>

<p>While the intensity of this pulsing, this vibration, does not grow, it
seems to expand in all directions, and then becomes softer and softer,
drawing me more deeply into it. Though my eyes are open, I catch a
glimpse of colored lights, felt as much as perceived.</p>

<p>Images begin flashing on the screen of my awareness at incredible
speeds. I embrace the emotion each brings, recognition dawning that each
is a part of me, each a lifetime, stretching back further and further,
seemingly without beginning. They appear and disappear in an instant. As
they fall away, I feel my body melting within itself, a deepening peace
embracing, penetrating every cell. I am dissolving, letting go of all
traces of resistance, all traces of denial, all traces of doubt -
dissolving more and more completely. Increasing space now between the
images as they become fewer, and fewer, and fewer until…there are
none.</p>

<p>I do not know how much time goes by, for here, time is not.</p>

<p>From the silence of an emptiness which is forever perfect fullness,
there emerges awareness, first of the reflection of my face in the
window before me, then of the ships at rest in the harbor, the still
waters, the flickering and radiant lights. They all seem to be contained
within the reflection on the window, they in me and I in them; I am one
with all things. In my reflection a faint smile begins to grow, a smile
that springs gently from the center of my heart.</p>

<p>I did not know it would be like this. I would never have guessed it.
Sitting here in this wonderful old rocking chair, the world so quiet in
this pre-dawn hour, nothing special taking place. Everything the same,
yet everything so different!</p>

<p>For this moment of eternity, gone the Dream.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will start writing.</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>Now,<br />
it is finished.<br />
Already,<br />
the choice is made.</p>

  <p>Now,<br />
the recognition<br />
is completed,<br />
coming as a thief in the night,<br />
stealing the cobwebs<br />
of shadows,<br />
revealing the illusion<br />
of a long-standing Dream<br />
to the Son who remembers.</p>

  <p>The end of a lonely journey,<br />
and the celebration<br />
of one begun anew.<br />
It is not a journey to,<br />
but within,<br />
the Kingdom.<br />
Thus is My promise fulfilled,<br />
for the Dream is burnt forever<br />
in the glory of the Father’s presence.</p>

  <p>Now,<br />
does life begin anew.<br />
Now,<br />
does life fulfill itself.<br />
And this,<br />
without effort.<br />
Welcome home,<br />
beloved brother,<br />
welcome home.</p>

  <p>Amen.</p>
