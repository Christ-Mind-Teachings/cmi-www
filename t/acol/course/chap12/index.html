    <p>12.1 The word love is part of your problem with this Course. If I were
to take the word love and change it to some sophisticated-sounding
technical term, and say this is the stuff that binds the world together
in unity, it would be easier for you to accept. If I were to say you
know not of this sophisticated term and this is why you have believed in
your separation rather than in your unity with all things, you would be
far more likely to nod your head and say, “I was but ignorant of this,
as was everyone else.” If a scientist were to tell you that a benign
energy had been found that proved your connection to everything in the
universe, and gave it some fancy name, you would say, “A new discovery
has been found and I am willing to believe it may be true, especially if
others are also going to believe it to be true.”</p>

<p>12.2 You feel a little duped at being told love is the answer. You
feel a little chastised to be told you know love not. You feel a little
deceived to think that love may not be limited to what you have thought
it to be. You think it is typical of a spiritual text to tell you love
is the answer, as if it has not been said before. This message was
preached long ago and still the world remains the same. How could this
be the correct answer when this is so? Life is too complicated to be
solved by love.</p>

<p>12.3 How quickly you would return to cynicism and to believing you
have already tried and failed. For all of you believe that you have
tried this idea called love, and all of you believe you have evidence
that it is not the answer at all. What is your evidence? Your own
failure to be happy and the unhappiness of the world you see.</p>

<p>12.4 We have said before the only meaning possible for your free will
is your choice of what to join with and your choice of what to leave
outside of yourself. Yet you must understand that nothing that is not
part of God is worthy of joining, nor can join with you. What you have
sought to join with is the reason for your unhappiness. For you seek to
join with what cannot be joined, and you seek separation from all that
could be joined with you and all that would fill your dark and lonely
places with the happiness you seek.</p>

<p>12.5 This Course may seem to have come far astray from what you would
have it do, for you are looking for something specific from it, though
you know it not. You are looking for the rest and quiet joy that only
comes from love. You are looking for the safety and security of a loving
home, even if it is one only of philosophy. You look for the soft
assurance of certainty, not of your mind but of your heart. There is a
part of you that thinks, “If I could just be sure…” and stops there, for
you are not even sure of what it is you seek assurance. And yet you know
what tires you most is your inability to be certain of anything. And you
are tired indeed.</p>

<p>12.6 God’s will for you is happiness, and of this you can be certain.
To align your will with God’s is but to make this certain state your
home. This is but a wish come true, and when it is all you wish for it
will come to be. And in the granting of this wish will come your rest
and the laying down of every heavy burden you have carried.</p>

<p>12.7 Admit now your desire to rest, a desire that could make you weep
and make you wish to sleep an endless sleep. If you but understood the
energy required to keep the world of your illusion in its place, you
would understand the rest that will simply come of giving up your need
to do so. Your desire for certainty is part of your resistance to any
ideas that seem to be about change. What little that you think you know
you would strive to keep, and yet deep down you realize that you know
nothing with the certainty you seek.</p>

<p>12.8 Uncertainty of any kind is doubt about your self. This is why
this Course aims to establish your identity, for from it all the rest
will come. As such, this Course seems to ask for change at every level,
and yet from one change alone will all the others follow—and through no
effort on your part at all. And even this one change is not a change at
all, for it merely seeks to remove all the changes you but think that
you have made to God’s creation. This change seeks but to restore you to
your Self.</p>

<p>12.9 Your Self rests totally unchanged within the Christ in you.
Re-establishing your relationship with your brother is what will show
your Self to you. You have one brother who wears but many faces in your
perception of who he is, and while you know him not you cannot know your
Self. This one brother can unite you with all whom you perceive as
others, for all others are one with him as well as you. This is the one
joining that needs to occur to bring about all the rest.</p>

<p>12.10 This is the one disjoining that your choice for separation
brought about, and it is but a separation from your Self. This is the
most difficult point to get across, because in it lies a contradiction,
the one contradiction that has created the world you see and the life
you live. Although it is impossible for something to have gone wrong in
God’s creation, something has gone wrong! All you need do is look about
you to know that this is so—and, rather than be discouraged by this
news, you breathe a sigh of relief because you knew this to be true and
yet have felt as if this is the secret that has been kept from you. It
is as if you are told endlessly “everything is fine” while you know this
is not true. And if “everything” is fine, it must just be you who are
all wrong.</p>

<p>12.11 All of creation seems to hum along in perfect harmony. The stars
light up the sky, the sun and moon do what they were appointed to do,
the animals of the sea, ground, and air are but what their Creator bade
them be, the mountains stand in all their majesty, rivers flow and
desert sands countless in number are blown endlessly about. Everything
seems to be what it is and what it has always been, but for, perhaps,
the mark of man upon it. Yet the moon remains the moon despite man’s
landing on it. The earth remains the earth despite your highways, roads
and bridges. And somewhere you know not, peace remains peace despite
your wars, and happiness remains happiness despite your despair.</p>

<p>12.12 Yet what of you? You, too, seem to have remained the same for
countless ages. Perhaps you believe that long ago you evolved from a
form different than that which you inhabit now; but certainly within the
laws of evolution, you have changed as little as the birds of the air or
fish of the sea. Yet somehow you know that in all of creation, it is
humanity alone that somehow is not what it was meant to be. On a lovely
day and in a lovely place you can see that creation’s paradise still
exists, but nowhere can you find the being God created in His image.</p>

<p>12.13 Does it make any sense at all that this would come to be? Or that
once upon a time there walked upon the earth those who did reveal God’s
image, and that when they ceased to be seen here God’s image was lost to
earth forever? Could even one have come and gone and left this void
forever more unfilled? A gaping hole within the universe itself?</p>

<p>12.14 But one was needed to end the separation, and in this one are all
the rest joined. For what alone in all creation could be affected by
your free will but your own self? But one was needed to, of his own free
will, join his will with his Father’s for it to be done for all. This is
all correction or atonement means, and all that is in need of your
acceptance. Join your brother who made this choice for all, and you are
reunited with the Christ in you.</p>

<p>12.15 Joined minds cannot think separately and have no hidden thoughts.
They are, in fact, not minds in the plural at all, but all-one-mind.
What this Course is saying is that at some point that does not exist in
time, God’s son made the choice for separation. Whether God’s son had
one form or many at that time matters not, for one form or many, there
was still one mind, the mind of God’s son joined in unity with that of
his Father. Many of you have been taught this mystery of faith. Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit are One. If you had indeed learned what you were
taught, the separation would be no more.</p>

<p>12.16 These words, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, like the word love,
are but symbols representing ideas that represent what is. That you have
made of the Father a singular figure, somehow greater than the Son, and
accepted the Holy Spirit as something largely not within your
understanding, only exemplifies the nature of the error in need of
correction. While words, as symbols, cannot fully explain what cannot be
symbolized, a beginning is made that must be completed through the
memories of your heart. So we continue, realizing that these words can
express the truth only within their ability as symbols, and that farther
than where these symbols can take you, the truth lies within your Self.</p>

<p>12.17 You have all seen the way a thought that seems to arise out of
nowhere can affect you. An idea, birthed one day, does not seem to have
been there the day before. Perhaps it is the idea of taking a trip or
having a baby, of returning to school, or quitting a job. This idea,
newly birthed, may seem to come and go, or may grow into an obsession,
but either way, it leaves not its source. And without the birth of the
idea, the results of the idea would not come to be. You may have a
thousand ideas one day and ten thousand the next, so many that you could
never keep track of them all, and yet they still exist within you and do
not splinter off and become something on their own apart from you.
Imagine this occurring and you will see how senseless this situation
would be. Could a trip happen on its own? To whom would it happen?</p>

<p>12.18 You may very well say, however, that an idea seemed to take on a
life of its own and compel you to do things you might have never dreamed
of doing. People often look back upon their lives and wonder how they
got from here to there, and some may see that one idea took root and
changed what seemed to be a destiny already written.</p>

<p>12.19 As near as words can describe the separation, this is what
occurred: An idea of separation entered the mind of God’s son. Like any
idea of yours, this idea did not leave its Source nor change the essence
of its Source in any way. While the idea of taking an adventurous
vacation when brought to fruition might reshape the life of the one
participating in it, it would not change who that person was, or who his
father was, or the nature of the family he was born into. All that would
change would be the shape of his life, the things that would happen
within it, perhaps the places in which it would occur or the people that
would be part of it. In short, the external aspects of the life.</p>

<p>12.20 From the idea of separation came the idea of an external aspect
of life. Before the idea of the separation, there was no such thing—and
there still is no such thing except as an extension of the original
idea. Just as we discussed your desire to protect or to control
proceeding from the concept of fear, and realized that without fear they
would not exist, so too is it with the external aspect of life. Without
the original idea of separation, the external aspect of life would not
exist. Just as fear is not real although it seems to be, separation is
not real although it seems to be.</p>

<p>12.21 The Father did not prevent the idea of separation from taking
place, and could not any more than you could prevent an idea from
occurring to you. Just as an idea of yours, once born, continues to
exist, so too, did this idea of separation. But just as your ideas do
not take on a life of their own even though they at times seem to, this
idea as well had no ability to be more than what it was, except for as
the son chose to participate in it.</p>

<p>12.22 Thus, the son’s participation in the idea of separation seemed to
bring about a completely reshaped life, a destiny different than that
which had already been written. Yet this participation could not but
proceed from the original idea and could not proceed in reality but only
in the external aspect of life that preceded it. The idea of separation
changed nothing in reality, but became a drama acted out upon a stage so
real that it seemed to be reality.</p>

<p>12.23 Separation is painful only to those who believe it can occur in
truth. What would a child’s rejection or a parent’s death mean to those
who did not believe in separation? Do you believe that God believes in
separation? He knows it not, and because He knows it not, it does not
exist. Because He knows it not, He has not been hurt by it. He knows no
rejection and no death. He knows no pain or sorrow. His son remains with
him in his eternal home, joined with him as always in eternal
completion.</p>

<p>12.24 Yet while the son’s extension into an external world is quite
real, it is all that is truly real within it. The son could not create
unlike the Father who created everything by extension of Himself.
Neither the Father’s extension, nor the Son’s, lessened Father or Son in
any way. Replace the word Father with the word Creation and see if this
does not help to make this concept clear. Could Creation’s continuing
extension of itself, its continuing creation, make less of it than what
it started out to be? What we call Father is but creation’s heavenly
face, a personification of what cannot truly be personified. You find it
hard to believe Creation itself can be benevolent and kind, or just
another name for love, but such it is. God is but creation’s starting
point, the creator of creation and yet Creation itself. The Son and Holy
Spirit, like unto Creation, proceeded from the starting point of God.
God is the Son and Holy Spirit’s starting point as well, the Creator of
the Son and Holy Spirit, yet He also is the Son and Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>12.25 Now, carry this pattern forward, for the pattern of God’s
extension is the pattern of creation and thus the pattern of the
universe. The Son extended himself into creation, and you are that
extension and as holy as is he. The idea of separation only seems to
have made God’s son susceptible to division, and these word symbols are
all that seem to separate Father, Son, and Holy Spirit from Creation or
from each other.</p>
