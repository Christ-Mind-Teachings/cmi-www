## User Profile
{: .disable-paragraph-marker}

When signed in, an option appears at the bottom of the <i class="question icon"></i> menu option called "User Profile". Click this option to access features for users with accounts. See [User Accounts](/acq/accounts/) to learn how to set up an account.

The only option currently available for signed in users is the creation and management of an email list.

## Setting Up a Maillist

Users who are signed in can share bookmarks by way of Facebook posts and email. When sharing by email you can pick recipients from a predefined email list and avoid having to remember or look up email addresses. 

When you choose the "User Profile" option from the <i class="question icon"></i> menu option the Maillist page will be displayed.

<div class="ui container" markdown="1">
  ![Empty Email List](/public/img/cmi/maillist-empty.jpg)
</div>

The table of email addresses will initally be empty. Notice that the "Save Changes" button is dimmed before changes are made. To add a new name press the "Add Name" button. This will display in input form allowing you to enter the name and email address of a recipient.

<div class="ui container" markdown="1">
  ![Add to Email List](/public/img/cmi/maillist-input.jpg)
</div>

Enter a name and email address and press "Add" to add the name to the list. Notice that the "Save Changes" button is now active. Make sure to save changes before exiting the page. It is only necessary to save changes once no matter how many changes you make.

The input form stays active until you press the "Cancel" button so that multiple entries can be easily added.

<div class="ui container" markdown="1">
  ![Item Added to Email List](/public/img/cmi/maillist-item.jpg)
</div>

An item in the list can be deleted by pressing the <i class="trash icon"></i> button and edited by pressing the <i class="pencil alternate icon"></i> button.

Again, make sure to save your changes before exiting the page otherwise they will be lost.
