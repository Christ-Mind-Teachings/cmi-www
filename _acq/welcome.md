Welcome to the Library of Christ Mind Teachings.
{: .disable-paragraph-marker}

The library is a collection of authoritative channeled insight and inspiration that offers a perspective on the individual and collective challenges of our lives and world that is not commonly taught. For many, this new perspective is immediately grasped as the only real solution to the problems of the world, from little anoyances to major conflict and from those of a personal nature to those that have a global effect.

The volumes in the library all teach the same thing but each source presents its message in a different way and often using somewhat different language. The content is the same just the form differs. The variety if forms of teachings support a deeper understanding of the material.

The library is orgainzed by teaching or *source* and each source contains one or more *books*. The [homepage](https://www.christmind.info) displays a cover that represents each source and a *Get Acquainted* guide. Click on a cover to display a table of contents for a book or to go to the homepage of a particular source.

Below are contents of the library.
