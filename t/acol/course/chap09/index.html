    <p>9.1 You wonder how it can be said that your heart is not deceived when
it seems so often to deceive you. It seems as fickle as your mind,
telling you one thing one day and one thing the next. Even more so than
your mind it seems to lead you astray, forcing you to walk through paths
full of danger and treachery into the deepest darkness instead of toward
the light. It is your emotions rather than your heart that would do this
to you.</p>

<p>9.2 Emotions speak the language of your separated self rather than the
language of your heart. They are the forward guard of your defense
system, always on the lookout for what might hurt or slight the little
you that they deem under their protection, or the other little selves
you deem under yours. But remember now how like to creation in form if
not in substance what you have made is. Creation needs no protection. It
is only your belief in the need for protection that has caused what you
feel to become so clouded by illusion. If you felt no need to protect
your heart, or any of those bodies that you love, your feelings would
retain their innocence and could not hurt you in any way.</p>

<p>9.3 The desire to protect is a desire that arises from distrust and is
based totally on fear. If there were no fear, what would there be to
protect? Thus, all of your love—the love that you imagine you keep
within yourself, and the love that you imagine you receive and give—is
tainted by your fear and cannot be real love. It is because you remember
love as that which kept you safe, that which kept you happy, that which
bound all those you love to you, that you attempt to use love here. This
is a real memory of creation that you have distorted. Your faulty memory
has caused you to believe love can be used to keep you safe, to make you
happy and bind to you those you choose to love. This is not the case,
for love cannot be used.</p>

<p>9.4 This is how you have distorted all relationship as well, making of
it something that only becomes real in its use by you or to you. In your
memory of creation you have remembered that all things exist in
relationship, and that all things happen in relationship. Thus you have
chosen to use relationship to prove your existence and to make things
happen. This use of relationship will never provide the proof or the
action you seek, because relationship cannot be used.</p>

<p>9.5 Look around the room in which you sit and take away the usefulness
from each thing you see in it. How many items would you keep that you
now look upon? Your body too was created for its usefulness. It sets you
apart, just as each item in your room is set apart by what it is useful
for. Ask yourself now: To whom is your body useful? This question does
not apply to those for whom you cook or clean, those whose bodies you
would repair or minds improve. The question is, really, who might have
seen a use for a body such as yours before it was created? What kind of
creator would create it and for what purpose?</p>

<p>9.6 You did not create your Self, but your body you did create. It was
created for its usefulness just like every other object that shares the
space you occupy. Think for a moment of what the creator of such a body
would have intended the body to be. The body is a finite entity, created
to be self-contained but also to self-destruct. It was created with a
need for constant maintenance, a maintenance that requires toil and
struggle. Every inch of its surface is a receiver and transmitter of
information yet it carries additional tools such as eyes and ears to
enhance its communication and to control what goes in and what goes out.
It is as susceptible to pain as to pleasure. It contains the means for
joining, but for joining that is of a temporary nature. It is as capable
of violence as gentleness. It is born and dies in a state of
helplessness.</p>

<p>9.7 The body could not help but be thus, as it was made with dual
purposes in mind. It was made to make real and then glorify a separated
self, and it was made to punish that separated self for the separation.
Its creator had in mind what is reflected in the body:
self-aggrandizement and self-effacement, pleasure and pain, violence and
gentleness. A desire to know everything but only through its own effort,
a desire to see everything but only through its own eyes, a desire to be
known but only through what it would choose to share. Alongside these
desires it is easy to see how a world such as that of the body
developed. Alongside the desire to know was the desire not to know.
Alongside the desire to see was the desire not to see. Alongside the
desire to share was the desire to be hidden. Alongside the desire to
live was the desire to live no more.</p>

<p>9.8 You have always been as you were created, but this is what you chose
to make from that with which you started. In other words, you took what
you are and made this of yourself. You did not create something from
nothing and you did not usurp the power of God. You took what God
created and turned it into an illusion so powerful that you believe it
is what you are, rather than believing in the truth. But just as you
have done this, you can undo this. This is the choice set before you—to
go on believing in the illusion you have made, or to begin to see the
truth.</p>

<p>9.9 Now you seek to know how to escape what you have made. To do so you
must withdraw all faith from it. This you are not ready yet to do, but
this is what your heart will now prepare you for. As you are prepared,
you walk alongside he who has waited for you with a single purpose
instead of alongside the conflicting desires you chose to let lead you
to this strange world. You travel lightly now where before you walked in
chains. You travel now with a companion who knows you as you are and
would show your Self to you.</p>

<p>9.10 Look upon your body now as you earlier looked upon the space you
occupy. Take away the body’s usefulness. Would you keep that which you
now look upon? As you stand back and observe your body, always with the
vision of your heart, think about just what it is that you would use it
for. What God created cannot be used, but what you have made can, for
its only purpose is your use. Choose to use it now to return you to your
real Self, and the new purpose you establish will change its conditions
as well as its usefulness to you.</p>

<p>9.11 All use is predicated on the simple idea that you do not have what
you need. You will continue to believe this while your allegiance
remains split. Until you have withdrawn all faith in what you have made,
you will believe that what you made remains useful to you. Since this is
the case, and since it cannot be changed without your total willingness
to change it—a willingness not yet complete—we will, instead of trying
to ignore what you have made, use it in a new way. Keep in mind,
however, that we are merely saving time, and that your real Self has no
need to use anything at all.</p>

<p>9.12 As stated before, what is most useful to us now is your perception
of your heart. Your illusions concerning it, when undone, will quickly
reveal to you the truth because your misperceptions concerning your
heart remain closer to the truth than any that you hold. The memories of
your heart are the strongest and purest that exist, and their
remembrance will help to still your mind and reveal the rest.</p>

<p>9.13 We thus return to your perception of your emotions and all that
causes you to feel. In your feelings, especially those you cannot name,
lies your connection to all that is. This is useful because what you
have named and classified is harder to dislodge and bring to light. Even
those feelings you attempt to name and keep cleverly in a box that you
have labeled this or that often are not content to stay where you would
place them. They seem to betray you, when it is you who betray them by
not allowing them to be what they are. This could be used as a capsule
definition of your entire problem: You do not allow anything that exists
in your world, including yourself, to be what it is.</p>

<p>9.14 Feelings that on their own seem to rebel against this insane
situation are guided by memories trying to reveal the truth to you. They
call to you from a place that you know not. The difficulty is that the
only self that is listening to this call is your separated self. It is
in the attempts of the separated self to interpret what feelings would
say that they become as distorted as all the rest. It is the separated
self that feels impelled to label feelings good and bad, some worthy of
acknowledgment and the rest worthy only of denial or contempt. It is
your language that gives emotion its place, one step behind fear, in
your battle to control or protect what you have made.</p>

<p>9.15 Fear always lies one step beneath the surface of a situation
because it lies one step beneath the surface of your self. Peel back the
first level of what your eyes allow you to observe and you will find
fear lurking there. The next level, depending on your disposition, is
either the desire to control or the desire to protect. They are really
the same but they wear different faces to the world. If, for the
purposes of our discussion, the body is the surface aspect of your self,
and if beneath that surface what is first encountered is fear, it is
from fear that all the rest proceeds. Surely it is easy to see that
neither the desire to control nor to protect would exist without the
layer of fear that comes before it.</p>

<p>9.16 Fear, like all the rest of your emotions, comes in many guises and
is given many names, but there are really only two emotions: one is
fear, the other love. Fear is thus the source of all illusion, love the
source of truth.</p>

<p>9.17 How could one separated off from all the rest not be fearful? It
matters not at all that all whom you observe seem to be separate as
well. No one really believes another to be as separate as he is. It
always seems as if others have what you lack and what you are looking
for. You seem to be alone in your frailty, loneliness, and lack of love.
Others misunderstand you and know you not, and neither can you make any
sense of them.</p>

<p>9.18 This need not be, for you are not separate! The relationships you
seek to end your loneliness can do so if you but learn to see
relationship differently. As with all your problems in perception, fear
is what blocks the vision of your heart, the light the Christ in you
would shine upon the darkness. Can you not see that when you chose to
make yourself separate and alone you also made the choice for fear? Fear
is nothing but a choice, and it can be replaced by choice of another
kind.</p>

<p>9.19 It has been said often that cause and effect are one in truth. The
world you see is the effect of fear. Each one of you would have
compassion for a child tormented by nightmares. Each parent’s most
fervent wish would be to tell a child truthfully there is no cause for
fear. Age has not taken fear from any of you nor made your dream of life
any less of a nightmare. Yet you spare few moments of compassion for
yourself, and when such chance occurrences come about you quickly
override compassion with practicality. While it makes sense to you to
attempt to dispel a child’s nightmare, you see no way to dispel your
own. You hide fear beneath the surface, and behind each alternative
label you would give it, in a desperate attempt to see it not. To live
in fear is, indeed, a curse, and one that you would try to tell yourself
is not present in your life. You look to others to feel compassion for,
to those living in countries torn by war or neighborhoods steeped in
violence. There is cause for fear, you say. But not here.</p>

<p>9.20 This is the only way you have been able to see to bring relief to
the nightmare of a life of fear. You project fear outward and away from
yourself, seeing not that you keep that which you would project. Seeing
not that outward signs of fear are but reflections of what you keep
within.</p>

<p>9.21 Think now of one of those you have identified as living the life of
fear you deny yourself. And imagine that you could bring this one in
from that dark and dangerous place. She is cold, and you prepare a fire
and give her a warm blanket for her knees. He is hungry and you prepare
a feast for him fit to serve a king. This one exists in the violence you
would keep outside your doors, and from your inner sanctum you give this
one a respite from the war that rages beyond it. All of your behavior
and even your fantasies testify that you believe an absence of cold
makes for warmth. That the absence of hunger is fullness. The absence of
violence peace. You think that if you but provide these things that are
opposite to what you would not want to have, you have accomplished much.
But a warm fire will only provide warmth as long as it is stoked. A meal
will provide fullness only until the next is needed. Your closed door
only keeps you safe while its boundary is respected. To replace the
temporary with the temporary is not an answer.</p>

<p>9.22 You may be thinking now that what I have just told you is not an
answer is precisely what the Bible has instructed you to do. I am
recorded as telling you to feed the hungry, to quench the thirst of the
thirsty, to welcome and give rest to the stranger. I have said when you
do this unto others you do this to me. Do you think that I am in need of
a meal, a cup of water, a warm bed? While you are trapped in the
illusion of need surely these acts of charity are of some value, but
again I tell you that this value is temporary. My words call you to the
eternal, to nourishment and rest of the spirit rather than the body.
That your sights are set on the care of the body alone is another
example of choosing an opposite for replacement.</p>

<p>9.23 Is this not your way of solving all the problems that you face? You
see what you do not want and try to replace it with its opposite. Your
life is thus spent in struggling against what you have for what you have
not. Only one example is needed to clarify the predicament in which you
have placed yourself. You feel lacking and so you want. You want and
want and want. You truly believe you do not have what you need, and so
make yourself continuously needy. You thus spend your life trying to
fulfill your needs. For most of you, this trying takes on the form of
work and you spend your entire life working to meet your needs and those
of the ones you love. What would you do with your life if you had no
needs to meet? What would you do with your life if you had no fear?
These questions are the same.</p>

<p>9.24 The only replacement that can occur that will accomplish what you
seek is the replacement of illusion with the truth, the replacement of
fear with love, the replacement of your separated self with your real
Self, the Self that rests in unity. It is your knowledge that this must
occur that leads you to attempt every other kind of replacement. You can
continue on in this fashion, always hoping that the next replacement
will be the one that succeeds in bringing you what you desire, or you
can choose instead the only replacement that will work.</p>

<p>9.25 All that you are asked to give up is your insane notion that you
are alone. We speak much of your body here only because it is your proof
of this insane idea’s validity. It is your proof as well that a life of
fear is warranted. How could you not fear for the safety of a home as
fragile as the body? How could you fail to provide the next meal for
yourself and those within your care? You do not see all that these
distractions of meeting needs would keep you from.</p>

<p>9.26 And yet the very reality that you have set up—the reality of not
being able to succeed in what you must constantly strive to do—is a
situation set up to provide relationship. Like everything else you have
remembered of creation and made in its image, so too is this. While
making yourself separate and alone you have also made it necessary to be
in relationship to survive. Without relationship your species itself
would cease to be, in fact, all life would end. Of course you must help
your sister and brother, for they are yourself, and they are your only
means to grasp eternity even within this false reality you have made.</p>

<p>9.27 Let us return to the example of feeding your sister’s hunger and
quenching your brother’s thirst. This is not only a lesson in feeding
and quenching spiritual hunger and thirst, but a lesson in relationship
as well. It is the relationship inherent in meeting another’s need that
makes the meeting of the need a thing of lasting value. It is your
willingness to say, “Brother, you are not alone” that is the benefit of
such situations, not only to your brother but also to you. It is in
saying, “Sister, you are not alone” that spiritual hunger and thirst is
met with the fullness of unity. It is in realizing that you are not
alone that you realize your unity with me and begin to turn from fear
toward love.</p>

<p>9.28 You are not your own creator. This is your salvation. You did not
create something from nothing, and what you started with is what God
created and remains as God created it. You do not have to ask yourself
to stretch your belief beyond these simple statements. Are they really
so implausible as to be beyond your acceptance? Is it so impossible to
imagine that what God created was distorted by your desire to have your
reality be other than what it is? Have you not seen this kind of
distortion take place within the reality you do see? Is this not the
story of the gifted son or daughter who squanders all the gifts he or
she possesses by seeing them not or by sadly distorting what they might
be useful for?</p>

<p>9.29 You are the prodigal sons and daughters welcomed constantly to
return home to your Father’s safe embrace.</p>

<p>9.30 Think of your automobile or computer or any other thing you use.
Without a user, would it have any function at all? Would it be anything?
An automobile abandoned and without a user might become the home to a
family of mice. A computer might be covered with a cloth, a flowerpot
placed on top of it. Someone not knowing what it is for would make of it
what he or she would have it be, but never would the user seek to
exchange roles with it. When an accident happens, an automobile cannot
be seen to be at fault for mistakes made by its user. Yet in a way this
exchange of roles is similar to what you have attempted to do and it is
like placing the blame for a car accident on the automobile. You have
attempted to change places with the body, claiming that it is using you
rather than that you are using it. You do so out of guilt in an attempt
to place your guilt outside yourself. “My body made me do it” is like
the cry of the child with an imaginary friend. With his claim of an
imaginary friend, the child announces that his body is not within his
control. What is your ego but an imaginary friend to you?</p>

<p>9.31 Child of God, you need no imaginary friend when you have beside you
he who is your friend always and would show you that you have no needs
at all. What you truly are cannot be used, not even by God. See you not
that it is only in illusion that you can use others who are like
yourself?</p>

<p>9.32 You learn your concept of using others from the reality you have
made in which you use the body that you call your home and identify as
your own self. How can the user and the object of use be one and the
same? This insanity makes the purpose of your life seem to be one of
usefulness. The more your body can be of use to others and to yourself,
the more worthwhile you see it as being. Ages have passed since creation
began, and still you have not learned the lesson of the birds of the air
or the flowers of the field. Two thousand years have passed since you
were told to observe this lesson. The lilies of the field neither sow
nor reap and yet they are provided for. The birds of the air live to
sing a song of gladness. So do you.</p>

<p>9.33 God’s will for you is happiness, and never has it been otherwise.
God’s creation is for eternity and has no use for time. Time too is of
your making, an idea of use gone mad, as once again you have taken
something made for your own use and allowed it to become the user. With
your own two hands you give away all your happiness and power to that
which you have made! It matters little now that in so doing you once
again imitated what your faulty memory would tell you that your Creator
did. God alone can give free will. In giving your power to things like
your body and to ideas like time your imitation of the gift of free will
is so falsely placed in illusion that you cannot see this madness for
what it truly is. Your body has no use for your power, and time was not
made for happiness.</p>

<p>9.34 The free will that God gave you is what has allowed you to make of
yourself and your world what you will. Now you look upon this world with
guilt and see it as evidence of your evil nature. It reinforces your
belief that you have changed too much from what you were to ever again
be worthy of your true inheritance. You fear that this, too, you would
squander and lay to ruin. The only thing that might succeed in proving
your place as that of royal inheritor would be if you could fix yourself
and the world, restoring it to a previous condition that you imagine you
know. In this scenario God is like unto your banker rather than your
Father. You would prove to God that you can “make a go of it” before you
would ask Him for His help.</p>

<p>9.35 As long as you do not want to be forgiven you will not feel the
gentle touch of forgiveness upon you and your world. While there is no
need in truth for this forgiveness, as there is no truth to this big
change that you believe you have undergone, your desire to be forgiven
is a first step away from your belief that you can fix things by
yourself and in so doing earn your way back into your Father’s home.
Being willing to be forgiven is the precursor of atonement, the state in
which you allow your errors to be corrected for you. These errors are
not the sins you hold against yourself, but merely your errors in
perception. Correction, or atonement, returns you to your natural state
where true vision lies and error and sin disappear.</p>

<p>9.36 Your natural state is one of union, and each joining that you do in
holy relationship returns a little of the memory of union to you. This
memory of your divinity is what you seek in truth from each special
relationship you enter into, but your true quest is hidden by the
concept of use that gets in its way. While your heart seeks for union,
your separated self seeks for what it can use to fill the emptiness and
ease the terror of its separation. What your heart seeks in love it
attains, but your separated self would keep this attainment from you by
turning every situation into a means to serve its ends. As long as union
is seen as a means only to keep loneliness from you it is not seen for
what it truly is.</p>

<p>9.37 You have placed limits on all things in your world, and it is these
limits of usefulness that would block your memory’s return. A love
relationship, while seen as the ultimate achievement in terms of the
closeness you can acquire with a brother or sister, is still limited by
what you would have it do. Its purpose, simply stated, is to supply a
lack. This is your definition of completion. What is missing in you is
found in another and together a sense of wholeness is achieved.</p>

<p>9.38 Again this is but a distortion of creation. You remember that
wholeness is achieved through union, but not how to accomplish it. You
have forgotten that only you can be accomplished. You believe that by
putting various parts together a whole can be achieved. You speak of
balance, and try to find something for one part of yourself in one place
and something for another somewhere else. This one fulfills your need
for friendship and that one for intellectual stimulation. In one
activity you express your creativity and in another your prayerfulness.
Like a diversified investment portfolio, you think this parceling out of
different aspects of yourself protects your assets. You fear “putting
all your eggs in one basket.” You seek to balance the things you label
drudgery and the things you label exciting. In doing so you see yourself
as “spending your time” wisely, and you call yourself a “wellrounded
individual.” As long as more than this is not sought, more than this
will not be realized.</p>

<p>9.39 Seeking what you have lost in other people, places, and things is
but a sign that you do not understand that what you have lost still
belongs to you. What you have lost is missing, not gone. What you have
lost is hidden to you but has not disappeared nor ceased to be. What you
have lost is valuable indeed, and this you know. But you know not what
this valuable something is. One thing alone is sure: When you have found
it you will know that it has been found. This is what will bring you
happiness and peace, contentment and a sense of belonging. This is what
will cause you to feel as if your time here has not been in vain. You
know that whatever else your life seems to be for, if on your deathbed
you have not found what you have sought, you will not leave in deepest
peace but in dark despair and fear. You will have no hope for what lies
beyond life, for you will have found no hope in life.</p>

<p>9.40 Your quest for what is missing thus becomes the race you run
against death. You seek it here, you seek it there, and scurry on to the
next thing and the next. Each person runs this race alone, with hope
only of victory for himself. You realize not that if you were to stop
and take your brother’s hand, the racecourse would become a valley full
of lilies, and you would find yourself on the other side of the finish
line, able at last to rest.</p>

<p>9.41 The injunction to rest in peace is for the living, not the dead.
But while you run the race you will know it not. Competition that leads
to individual achievement has become the idol you would glorify, and you
need not look far for evidence that this is so. This idolatry tells you
that glory is for the few, and so you take your place in line at the
starting gate and make your bid for glory. You run the race as long as
you can and, win or lose, your participation in the race was but the
required offering to the idol you have made. And at some point, when you
can run the race no more, you bow down to those who have achieved glory;
they become your idols and you become their subjects, watching what they
do with envy and with awe. To these you make your sacrifices and pay
your homage. To these you say, “I would be like you.” To these you look
for a vicarious fulfillment, having given up any hope for real
fulfillment. Here you are entertained, shocked, excited, or repelled.
Here you watch the gladiators kill one another for your amusement. Here
is your notion of use displayed in all its most horrific detail.</p>

<p>9.42 What is this but a demonstration, on a larger scale, of what you
live each day? This is all that anything larger than yourself
demonstrates to you. All society, groups, teams, and organizations are
but a collective portrayal of individual desire. Slaves and masters but
use one another and the same laws bind both. Who is master and who is
slave in this body you would call your home? What freedom would you have
without the demands your body places upon you? The same question can be
asked of this world you see as home to the body. Which is master and
which is slave when both are held in bondage? The glory you give idols
is but bondage as well. Without your idolatry their glory would be no
more, and so they live in fear no less than that of those who idolize
them.</p>

<p>9.43 Use, in any form, leads to bondage, and so to perceive a world
based on use is to see a world where freedom is impossible. What you
think you need your sister for is thus based upon this insane premise
that freedom can be purchased and that master is freer than slave.
Although this is illusion, it is the illusion that is sought. The
purchase price is usefulness. And so each joining is seen as a bartering
in which you trade your usefulness for that of another. An employer has
use for your skills and you have use for the salary and benefits the
employer offers. A spouse is useful in many ways that complement your
areas of usefulness. A store provides you with goods that you would use,
and you supply a store with capital that its owner will use. If you are
gifted with beauty or athletic or artistic talent that can be used, how
lucky you think you are. A beautiful face and a fit body can be traded
for so much. It is no secret that you live in a world of supply and
demand. From the simple concept of individuals needing to be in
relationship to survive has grown this complex web of use and abuse.</p>

<p>9.44 Abuse is but improper use—use on a scale that makes the insanity of
use obvious to both the user and the usee, and so has its proper place
in our discussion here. Look at patterns of abuse, in everything from
drugs and alcohol to physical or emotional mistreatment. These, like the
larger examples of your daily life gone awry, are but demonstrations of
internal desires taken to a greater extreme; only these, rather than
being reflected by the group, are reflected within the individual. The
individual with issues of abuse would do a service to the world if the
people in it were to understand what that abuse is a reflection of. Like
any extreme, it merely points out what in less extreme instances is
still the same: Use is improper.</p>

<p>9.45 It is its purpose that makes use improper. The Holy Spirit can
guide you to use the things that you have made in ways that benefit the
whole, and this is the distinction between proper and improper use, or
use and abuse. You would use for the benefit of the separated self. When
magnified, the destructive force of such abuse is easily apparent. Again
you would place the blame outside yourself and label drugs, alcohol,
tobacco, gambling, and even food as destructive forces. Like the
automobile you would blame for an accident, user and usee have become
confused. All such confusion stems from the initial confusion of the use
you think your body would put you to. All such confusion stems from your
displacement of yourself and your abdication of your power to the things
that you have made.</p>

<p>9.46 Let me say again that this is your misguided attempt to follow in
creation’s way. God gave all power to his creations, and you would
choose to do this as well. Your intent is not evil, but guided by the
guilt and false remembering of the separated self. As much as you have
desired anonymity and autonomy from God, still you blame God for
creating a situation in which you think you have been allowed to hurt
yourself. How could God allow all this suffering, you ask? Why does He
tempt you with such destructive forces? Forces beyond your control? Why
did not God create a world benign and unable to harm you?</p>

<p>9.47 Such is the world that God did create: A world so lovely and so
peaceful that when you see it once again you will cry with joy and
forget your sadness in an instant. There will be no long remembering of
regrets, no feeling badly for all the years in which you saw this not.
There will merely be a glad “Aha!” as what was long forgotten is
returned to you. You will but smile at the childish games you played,
and have no more regrets than you would have for your childhood. Your
innocence will stand out clearly here, and never again will you doubt
that the world that God created belongs to you and you to it.</p>

<p>9.48 All your vast wanderings will be seen for what they are. All that
you desired will be revealed as only two desires, the desire to love and
the desire to be loved. Why wait to see that these desires are all that
call you to the strange behavior you display? Those who give in to abuse
are merely calling louder for the selfsame love that all are in search
of. Judgment is not due them, for all here are abusers—starting with
their own selves.</p>

<p>9.49 Attempts to modify the behavior of abuse are near to useless in a
world based on use. The foundation of the world must change, and the
stimulus for this change lies within you. All use ends with joining, for
use is what you have traded joining for. Instead of recognizing your
union, a state in which you are whole and complete because you are
joined with all, you have determined to stand separate and use the rest
to support your separate stance. See you the difference in these two
positions? In what way is your way better than the way God created for
you, a way that is completely free of conflict? Despite your bravest
attempts to remain separate, you must use your brothers and sisters in
order to even maintain the illusion of your separation. Would it not
simply be better to end this charade? To admit that you were not created
for separation but for union? To begin to let go of your fear of
joining, and as you do let go of use as well?</p>

<p>9.50 How different would the world be if you would but attempt for one
day to replace use with union! Before you can begin, however, we must
expand on the lessons you are learning by observing your own self. Now
we seek to uncover the illusion that you can be used by your body, for
your own seeming use by such as this leads to all other ideas of use.</p>
